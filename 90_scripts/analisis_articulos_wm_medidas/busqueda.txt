AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, 
      neuroinflammation, and impaired neurogenesis. Urolithin A (UA), a gut-microbial 
      metabolite of ellagic acid, has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects 
      in the brain. However, it is unknown whether UA exerts its properties of 
      anti-inflammation and neuronal protection in the APPswe/PS1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) mouse 
      model of AD. METHODS: Morris water maze was used to detect the cognitive 
      function. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling 
      (TUNEL) assay was performed to detect neuronal apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry 
      analyzed the response of glia, Aβ deposition, and neurogenesis. The expression of 
      inflammatory mediators were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
      and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The modulating 
      effects of UA on cell signaling pathways were assayed by Western blotting. 
      RESULTS: We demonstrated that UA ameliorated cognitive impairment, prevented 
      neuronal apoptosis, and enhanced neurogenesis in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, UA 
      attenuated Aβ deposition and peri-plaque microgliosis and astrocytosis in the 
      cortex and hippocampus. We also found that UA affected critical cell signaling 
      pathways, specifically by enhancing cerebral AMPK activation, decreasing the 
      activation of P65NF-κB and P38MAPK, and suppressing Bace1 and APP degradation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that UA imparted cognitive protection by 
      protecting neurons from death and triggering neurogenesis via anti-inflammatory 
      signaling in APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that UA might be a promising therapeutic 
      drug to treat AD.

AB  - Macroautophagy/autophagy is generally regarded as a cytoprotective mechanism, and 
      it remains a matter of controversy whether autophagy can cause cell death in 
      mammals. Here, we show that chronic restraint stress suppresses adult hippocampal 
      neurogenesis in mice by inducing autophagic cell death (ACD) of hippocampal 
      neural stem cells (NSCs). We generated NSC-specific, inducible Atg7 conditional 
      knockout mice and found that they had an intact number of NSCs and neurogenesis 
      level under chronic restraint stress and were resilient to stress- or 
      corticosterone-induced cognitive and mood deficits. Corticosterone treatment of 
      adult hippocampal NSC cultures induced ACD via SGK3 (serum/glucocorticoid 
      regulated kinase 3) without signs of apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that ACD 
      is biologically important in a mammalian system in vivo and would be an 
      attractive target for therapeutic intervention for psychological stress-induced 
      disorders.Abbreviations: AAV: adeno-associated virus; ACD: autophagic cell death;

TI  - Chronic Supplementation with a Mix of Salvia officinalis and Salvia 
      lavandulaefolia Improves Morris Water Maze Learning in Normal Adult C57Bl/6J 
      Mice.
LID - 10.3390/nu12061777 [doi]
LID - 1777
AB  - Background: Two different species of sage, Salvia officinalis and Salvia 
      lavandulaefolia, have demonstrated activities in cognitive function during 
      preclinical and clinical studies related to impaired health situations or single 
      administration. Different memory processes have been described to be 
      significantly and positively impacted. Objective: Our objective is to explore the 
      potential of these Salvia, and their additional activities, in healthy 
      situations, and during prolonged administration, on memory and subsequent 
      mechanisms of action related to putative effects. Design: This mouse study has 
      implicated four investigational arms dedicated to control, Salvia officinalis 
      aqueous extract, Salvia lavandulaefolia-encapsulated essential oil and a mix 
      thereof (Cognivia™) for 2 weeks of administration. Cognitive functions have been 
      assessed throughout Y-maze and Morris water maze models. The impact of 
      supplementation on lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, neurogenesis, neuronal 
      activity, neurotrophins, neurotrophin receptors, CaM kinase II and glucocorticoid 
      receptors has been assessed via post-interventional tissue collection. Results: 
      All Salvia groups had a significant effect on Y-maze markers on day 1 of 
      administration. Only the mix of two Salvia species demonstrated significant 
      improvements in Morris water maze markers at the end of administration. 
      Considering all biological and histological markers, we did not observe any 
      significant effect of S. officinalis, S. lavandulaefolia and a mix of Salvia 
      supplementation on lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress and neuronal plasticity 
      (neurogenesis, neuronal activity, neurotrophins). Interestingly, CaM kinase II 
      protein expression is significantly increased in animals supplemented with 
      Salvia. Conclusion: The activities of Salvia alone after one intake have been 
      confirmed; however, a particular combination of different types of Salvia have 
      been shown to improve memory and present specific synergistic effects after 
      chronic administration in healthy mice.

AB  - Amyloid β (Aβ) plays a major role in the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD). The accumulation of misfolded Aβ causes oxidative stress and inflammatory 
      damage leading to apoptotic cell death. Traditional Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) 
      has been widely used in treating neurodegenerative diseases by reducing oxidative 
      stress and neuroinflammation. We examined the neuroprotective effect of 
      formulated CHM Shaoyao Gancao Tang (SG-Tang, made of Paeonia lactiflora and 
      Glycyrrhiza uralensis at 1:1 ratio) in AD cell and mouse models. In Aβ-GFP 
      SH-SY5Y cells, SG-Tang reduced Aβ aggregation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
      production, as well as improved neurite outgrowth. When the Aβ-GFP-expressing 
      cells were stimulated with conditioned medium from interferon (IFN)-γ-activated 
      HMC3 microglia, SG-Tang suppressed expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase 
      (iNOS), NLR family pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1) and 3 (NLRP3), tumor 
      necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, attenuated caspase-1 
      activity and ROS production, and promoted neurite outgrowth. In 
      streptozocin-induced hyperglycemic APP/PS1/Tau triple transgenic (3×Tg-AD) mice, 
      SG-Tang also reduced expressions of NLRP1, NLRP3, Aβ and Tau in hippocampus and 
      cortex, as well as improved working and spatial memories in Y maze and Morris 
      water maze. Collectively, our results demonstrate the potential of SG-Tang in 
      treating AD by moderating neuroinflammation.

TI  - Rifaximin-mediated gut microbiota regulation modulates the function of microglia 
      and protects against CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors in adolescent rat.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) can not only lead to 
      depression-like behavior but also change the composition of the gut microbiome. 
      Regulating the gut microbiome can have an antidepressant effect, but the 
      mechanism by which it improves depressive symptoms is not clear. Short-chain 
      fatty acids (SCFAs) are small molecular compounds produced by the fermentation of 
      non-digestible carbohydrates. SFCAs are ubiquitous in intestinal endocrine and 
      immune cells, making them important mediators of gut microbiome-regulated body 
      functions. The balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory microglia plays an 
      important role in the occurrence and treatment of depression caused by chronic 
      stress. Non-absorbable antibiotic rifaximin can regulate the structure of the gut 
      microbiome. We hypothesized that rifaximin protects against stress-induced 
      inflammation and depression-like behaviors by regulating the abundance of fecal 
      microbial metabolites and the microglial functions. METHODS: We administered 
      150 mg/kg rifaximin intragastrically to rats exposed to CUMS for 4 weeks and 
      investigated the composition of the fecal microbiome, the content of short-chain 
      fatty acids in the serum and brain, the functional profiles of microglia and 
      hippocampal neurogenesis. RESULTS: Our results show that rifaximin ameliorated 
      depressive-like behavior induced by CUMS, as reflected by sucrose preference, the 
      open field test and the Morris water maze. Rifaximin increased the relative 
      abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, which were significantly 
      positively correlated with the high level of butyrate in the brain. Rifaximin 
      increased the content of anti-inflammatory factors released by microglia, and 
      prevented the neurogenic abnormalities caused by CUMS. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      suggest that rifaximin can regulate the inflammatory function of microglia and 
      play a protective role in pubertal neurodevelopment during CUMS by regulating the 
      gut microbiome and short-chain fatty acids.

TI  - Cranial Bone Transport Promotes Angiogenesis, Neurogenesis, and Modulates 
      Meningeal Lymphatic Function in Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Rats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. 
      However, the time window for quickly dissolving clots and restoring cerebral 
      blood flow, using tissue-type plasminogen activator treatment is rather limited, 
      resulting in many patients experiencing long-term functional impairments if not 
      death. This study aims to determine the roles of cranial bone transport (CBT), a 
      novel, effective, and simple surgical technique, in the recovery of ischemic 
      stroke using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model. METHODS: CBT was 
      performed by slowly sliding a bone segment in skull with a special frame and a 
      speed of 0.25 mm/12 hours for 10 days following MCAO. Morris water maze, rotarod 
      test, and catwalk gait analysis were used to study the neurological behaviors, 
      and infarct area and cerebral flow were evaluated during CBT process. 
      Immunofluorescence staining of CD31 and Nestin/Sox2 (sex determining region Y box 
      2) was performed to study the angiogenesis and neurogenesis. OVA-A647 
      (ovalbumin-Alexa Fluor 647) was intracisterna magna injected to evaluate the 
      meningeal lymphatic drainage function. RESULTS: CBT treatment has significantly 
      reduced the ischemic lesions areas and improved the neurological deficits in MCAO 
      rats compared with the rats in the control groups. CBT treatment significantly 
      promoted angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the brain of MCAO rats. The drainage 
      function of meningeal lymphatic vessels in MCAO rats was significantly impaired 
      compared with normal rats. Ablation of meningeal lymphatic drainage led to 
      increased neuroinflammation and aggravated neurological deficits and ischemic 
      injury in MCAO rats. CBT treatment significantly improved the meningeal lymphatic 
      drainage function and alleviated T-cell infiltration in MCAO rats. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study provided evidence for the possible mechanisms on how CBT attenuates 
      ischemic stroke injury and facilitates rapid neuronal function recovery, 
      suggesting that CBT may be an alternative treatment strategy for managing 
      ischemic stroke.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A crosstalk exists between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 
      diabetic encephalopathy displays AD-like disorders. Sarsasapogenin (Sar) has 
      strong anti-inflammatory efficacy, showing neuroprotection and memory-enhancement 
      effects. PURPOSE: This study aims to verify the ameliorative effects of Sar on 
      diabetic encephalopathy in vivo and in vitro, and to clarify the mechanisms from 
      attenuation of AD-like pathology. METHODS: Streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic 
      rats and high glucose-cultured SH-SY5Y cells were used in this study. After Sar 
      treatment (20 and 60 mg/kg) for consecutive 9 weeks, Morris water maze and novel 
      object recognition tasks were performed. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used for 
      examining loss of neurons in CA1 area and ki67 expression for reflecting 
      neurogenesis in DG area of hippocampus. Aβ production pathway and tau 
      phosphorylation kinase cascade were examined in these two models. RESULTS: Sar 
      improved learning and memory ability, loss of neurons and reduction of 
      neurogenesis in the hippocampus of diabetic rats. Moreover, Sar suppressed Aβ 
      overproduction due to up-regulation of BACE1 in protein and mRNA and tau 
      hyperphosphorylation from inactivation of AKT/GSK-3β cascade in the hippocampus 
      and cerebral cortex of diabetic rats and high glucose-cultured SH-SY5Y cells, and 
      PPARγ antagonism abolished the effects of Sar on key molecules in the two 
      pathways. Additionally, it was found that high glucose-stimulated Aβ 
      overproduction was prior to tau hyperphosphorylation in neurons. CONCLUSION: Sar 
      alleviated diabetic encephalopathy, which was obtained through inhibitions of Aβ 
      overproduction and tau hyperphosphorylation mediated by the activation of PPARγ 
      signaling. Hence, Sar is a good candidate compound for AD-like disorders.

TI  - Eucommiae cortex polysaccharides mitigate obesogenic diet-induced cognitive and 
      social dysfunction via modulation of gut microbiota and tryptophan metabolism.
PG  - 3637-3655
LID - 10.7150/thno.72756 [doi]
AB  - Rationale: The high fat and sucrose diet, known as the obesogenic diet (OD), has 
      been related to low-grade chronic inflammation and neurodevelopmental disorders. 
      Emerging evidence suggests that OD influences cognitive and social function via 
      the gut-brain axis. However, the effects of OD during adolescence on future 
      health have been unclear. Meanwhile, the underlying mechanisms and effective 
      interventions are not fully understood. Polysaccharides, one of the most abundant 
      substances in the Eucommiae cortex, exhibit potential immunomodulatory and 
      neuroprotective effects. Here, we aimed to investigate the impact of OD on 
      adolescents, explore the modulating roles of Eucommiae cortex polysaccharides 
      (EPs) on OD-induced behavioral dysfunction, and elucidate the underlying 
      molecular mechanisms. Methods: In the present study, four-week-old mice were fed 
      with OD for four weeks to simulate persistent OD in adolescents. The behavioral 
      features were accessed by open field test and Morris water maze. The gut 
      bacterial structure was identified by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The gene 
      and protein expression in colonic tissues and hippocampus were detected by 
      qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and 
      immunofluorescence staining. Detection of biological metabolites in serum and 
      hippocampal tissues was performed by widely targeted metabolomics and targeted 
      metabolomics. Results: We found that OD-fed mice showed cognitive and 
      social-behavioral deficits accompanied by gut dysbiosis and systematic tryptophan 
      (Trp) metabolism disorders, which increased kynurenine (Kyn) concentration in the 
      hippocampus. Bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) induced 
      microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, directing the metabolism of Kyn in the 
      hippocampus toward quinolinic acid (QA), which led to glutamate-mediated 
      hyperactivation of mossy cells (MCs) in hippocampal hilus. Furthermore, OD 
      impaired parvalbumin (PV) interneurons-related local circuits in the hippocampal 
      granule cell layer. These resulted in hippocampal neurogenesis deficits and 
      related behavioral dysfunction in mice. EPs supplementation ameliorated 
      OD-induced gut dysbiosis, as evidenced by inhibiting the expansion of Escherichia 
      coli (E.coli) and reducing the concentration of LPS in colonic contents and 
      serum, thereby inhibiting the subsequent neuroinflammation. In addition, oral EPs 
      suppressed the peripheral Kyn pathway to reduce the concentration of QA and 
      glutamic acid in the hippocampus of OD-fed mice, thereby rescuing the glutamic 
      acid-triggered neuroexcitotoxicity. These contributed to remodeling the rhythm of 
      hippocampal neurogenesis and mitigated behavioral dysfunction in OD-fed mice. 
      Conclusions: The present study addresses a gap in the understanding of neuronal 
      dysfunction associated with OD during adolescence and provides the first evidence 
      that EPs improved cognitive and social behavior via modulation of gut microbiota 
      and tryptophan metabolism in adolescent mice fed with OD, which may represent 
      novel preemptive therapy for neurodevelopmental disorders via manipulation of the 
      tryptophan metabolite.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrodiae Rhizoma (Tianma), the dried tuber of Gastrodia elata Bl. 
      (Orchidaceae), is listed as a top-grade herbal medicine in Shen-nong Ben-ts'ao 
      Jing and has been used for treating headaches, dizziness, vertigo and convulsion. 
      It has a neuroprotective effect and extends the lifespan in mouse models of 
      Huntington's disease and Niemann-Pick type C disease. However, its effect on 
      senescence remains unknown. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the 
      anti-aging effects and the underlying mechanism of Gastrodiae Rhizoma. METHODS: 
      D-galactose (D-gal)- and BeSO(4)-induced cellular senescence and 
      senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity were evaluated in 
      SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells. D-gal-induced aging mice were used as an in vivo model. 
      Animal behaviors including nesting and burrowing and Morris water maze were 
      conducted. Neurogenesis in the hippocampus was assessed by immunohistochemistry 
      and confocal microscopy, and the aging-related proteins were assessed by Western 
      blot analysis. The potential neuritogenesis activity of the partially purified 
      fraction of Gastrodiae Rhizoma (TM-2) and its major ingredients were investigated 
      in PC12 cells. RESULTS: TM-2 could improve D-gal-induced learning and memory 
      impairement by inhibiting oxidative stress, increasing hippocampal neurogenesis 
      and regulating the SH2B1-Akt pathway. Moreover, N(6)-(4-hydroxybenzyl)adenine 
      riboside (T1-11) and parishins A and B, three constituents of TM-2, had 
      anti-aging activity, as did T1-11 and parishin A induced neuritogenesis. 
      CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that TM-2 slowed down D-gal-induced cellular and 
      mouse brain aging. These results indicate that Gastrodiae Rhizoma has a 
      beneficial effect on senescence. It may be used for neuroprotection and promoting 
      neurogenesis.

TI  - Gastrodin promotes hippocampal neurogenesis via PDE9-cGMP-PKG pathway in mice 
      following cerebral ischemia.

AB  - Gastrodin, which is extracted from the Chinese herbal medicine Gastrodia elata 
      Blume, can ameliorate neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia. However, it's 
      possible underlying mechanisms remain still elusive. PDE9-cGMP-PKG signaling 
      pathway is involved in the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) after 
      cerebral ischemia. In this study, we investigated whether the beneficial effect 
      of gastrodin on hippocampal neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia is correlated 
      with the PDE9-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. Bilateral common carotid artery 
      occlusion (BCCAO) in mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in 
      primary cultured hippocampal NSCs were used to mimic brain ischemic injury. The 
      Morris water maze (MWM) test was executed to detect spatial learning and memory. 
      Proliferation, differentiation, and mature neurons were examined using 
      immunofluorescence. The survival and proliferation of NSCs were assessed by CCK-8 
      assay and BrdU immunofluorescence staining, respectively. ELISA and western blot 
      were used to detect the level of the PDE9-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. In BCCAO 
      mice, administering gastrodin (50 and 100 mg/kg) for 14 d restored cognitive 
      behaviors; meanwhile, neurogenesis in hippocampus was stimulated, and PDE9 was 
      inhibited and cGMP-PKG was activated by gastrodin. Consistent with the results, 
      administering gastrodin (from 0.01-1 μmol/L) for 48 h dose-dependently 
      ameliorated the cell viability and promoted greatly the proliferation in primary 
      hippocampal NSCs exposed to OGD/R. Gastrodin further decreased PDE9 activity and 
      up-regulated cGMP-PKG level. KT5823, a PKG inhibitor, markedly abrogated the 
      protective effects of gastrodin on OGD/R-injured NSCs, accompanied by the 
      down-regulation of PKG protein expression, but had no effects on PDE9 activity 
      and cGMP level. Gastrodin could accelerate hippocampal neurogenesis after 
      cerebral ischemia, which is mediated, at least partly, by PDE9-cGMP-PKG signaling 
      pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rosmarinus officinalis, commonly known as rosemary, is a medicinal 
      herb that presents significant biological properties such as antimicrobial, 
      antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic and anti-depressant activities. 
      Recent findings correlate impaired adult neurogenesis, which is crucial for the 
      maintenance of synaptic plasticity and hippocampal functioning, synaptic 
      regulation with the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These 
      observations call for the need to developing compounds that promote neurogenesis 
      and alleviates deficits in cognition and synaptic regulation. PURPOSE AND STUDY 
      DESIGN: The present study was conducted to determine the proneurogenic effects of 
      R. officinalis and its active compounds (ursolic acid and rosmarinic acid) in 
      comparison to Donepezil in an Aβ(1-42)-induced mouse model of AD. METHODS: BALB/c 
      mice were divided into ten groups. Half were injected with Aβ(1-42) in the 
      hippocampus through stereotaxic surgery to generate the disease groups. The other 
      half received control injections. Each set of five groups were administered 
      orally with vehicle, an ethanolic extract of R. officinalis, ursolic acid, 
      rosmarinic acid or donepezil. Behavior analysis included the Morris water maze 
      test, the novel object recognition test and the Elevated plus maze. The mice were 
      then sacrificed and the hippocampal tissue was processed for immunohistochemistry 
      and gene expression analysis. RESULTS: The results show a protective effect by 
      rosmarinic acid and ursolic acid in reversing the deficits in spatial and 
      recognition memory as well as changes in anxiety induced by Aβ(1-42.) The 
      neuronal density and the expression levels of neurogenic (Ki67, NeuN and DCX) and 
      synaptic (Syn I, II, III, Synaptophysin and PSD-95) markers were also normalized 
      upon treatment with rosmarinic and ursolic acid. CONCLUSION: Our findings 
      indicate the potential of R. officinalis and its active compounds as therapeutic 
      agents against Aβ(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity in AD.

AB  - Studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes can enhance neural 
      plasticity and improve cognitive impairment. The purpose of this study was to 
      investigate the effects of mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes on neurogenesis 
      and cognitive capacity in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's 
      disease mouse models were established by injection of beta amyloid 1-42 
      aggregates into dentate gyrus bilaterally. Morris water maze and novel object 
      recognition tests were performed to evaluate mouse cognitive deficits at 14 and 
      28 days after administration. Afterwards, neurogenesis in the subventricular zone 
      was determined by immunofluorescence using doublecortin and PSA-NCAM antibodies. 
      Results showed that mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes stimulated 
      neurogenesis in the subventricular zone and alleviated beta amyloid 1-42-induced 
      cognitive impairment, and these effects are similar to those shown in the 
      mesenchymal stem cells. These findings provide evidence to validate the 
      possibility of developing cell-free therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's 
      disease. All procedures and experiments were approved by Institutional Animal 
      Care and Use Committee (CICUAL) (approval No. CICUAL 2016-011) on April 25, 2016.

TI  - Acute pre-operative ibuprofen improves cognition in a rat model for postoperative 
      cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammation is considered a key factor in the development of 
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Therefore, we hypothesized that 
      pre-operative anti-inflammatory treatment with ibuprofen would inhibit POCD in 
      our rat-model. METHODS: Male Wistar rats of 3 or 23 months old received a single 
      injection of ibuprofen (15 mg/kg i.p.) or were control handled before abdominal 
      surgery. Timed blood and fecal samples were collected for analyses of 
      inflammation markers and gut microbiome changes. Behavioral testing was performed 
      from 9 to 14 days after surgery, in the open field, novel object- and novel 
      location-recognition tests and Morris water maze. Neuroinflammation and 
      neurogenesis were assessed by immune histochemistry after sacrifice on 
      postoperative day 14. RESULTS: Ibuprofen improved short-term spatial memory in 
      the novel location recognition test, and increased hippocampal neurogenesis. 
      However, these effects were associated with increased hippocampal microglia 
      activity. Whereas plasma cytokine levels (IL1-β, IL6, IL10, and TNFα) were not 
      significantly affected, VEGF levels increased and IFABP levels decreased after 
      ibuprofen. Long-term memory in the Morris water maze was not significantly 
      improved by ibuprofen. The gut microbiome was neither significantly affected by 
      surgery nor by ibuprofen treatment. In general, effects in aged rats appeared 
      similar to those in young rats, though less pronounced. CONCLUSION: A single 
      injection of ibuprofen before surgery improved hippocampus-associated short-term 
      memory after surgery and increased neurogenesis. However, this favorable outcome 
      seemed not attributable to inhibition of (neuro)inflammation. Potential 
      contributions of intestinal and blood-brain barrier integrity need further 
      investigation. Although less pronounced compared to young rats, effects in aged 
      rats indicate that even elderly individuals could benefit from ibuprofen 
      treatment.

TI  - Knockdown of long non-coding RNA SOX2OT downregulates SOX2 to improve hippocampal 
      neurogenesis and cognitive function in a mouse model of sepsis-associated 
      encephalopathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aberrant hippocampal neurogenesis is an important pathological 
      feature of sepsis-associated encephalopathy. In the current study, we examined 
      the potential role of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) sex-determining region 
      Y-box 2 (SOX2) overlapping transcript (SOX2OT), a known regulator of adult 
      neurogenesis in sepsis-induced deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive 
      function. METHODS: Sepsis was induced in adult C57BL/6 J male mice by cecal 
      ligation and perforation (CLP) surgery. Randomly selected CLP mice were 
      transfected with short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against SOX2OT or SOX2, or with 
      scrambled control siRNA. Cognitive behavior was tested 8-12 days post-surgery 
      using a Morris water maze. Western blotting and RT-qPCR were used to determine 
      expression of SOX2, Ki67, doublecortin (DCX), nestin, brain lipid-binding 
      protein, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the hippocampus. The 
      number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)(+)/DCX(+) cells, BrdU(+)/neuronal nuclei 
      (NeuN)(+) neurons, and BrdU(+)/GFAP(+) glial cells in the dentate gyrus were 
      assessed by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: CLP mice showed progressive increases in 
      SOX2OT and SOX2 mRNA levels on days 3, 7, and 14 after CLP surgery, accompanied 
      by impaired cognitive function. Sepsis led to decrease in all neuronal markers in 
      the hippocampus, except GFAP. Immunofluorescence confirmed the decreased numbers 
      of BrdU(+)/DCX(+) cells and BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) neurons, and increased numbers of 
      BrdU(+)/GFAP(+) cells. SOX2OT knockdown partially inhibited the effects of CLP on 
      levels of SOX2 and neuronal markers, neuronal populations in the hippocampus, and 
      cognitive function. SOX2 deficiency recapitulated the effects of SOX2OT 
      knockdown. CONCLUSION: SOX2OT knockdown improves sepsis-induced deficits in 
      hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function by downregulating SOX2 in mice. 
      Inhibiting SOX2OT/SOX2 signaling may be effective for treating or preventing 
      neurodegeneration in sepsis-associated encephalopathy.

TI  - Electroacupuncture promotes the survival and synaptic plasticity of hippocampal 
      neurons and improvement of sleep deprivation-induced spatial memory impairment.
PG  - 1472-1482

AB  - AIMS: This study aimed to investigate whether electroacupuncture (EA) promotes 
      the survival and synaptic plasticity of hippocampal neurons by activating 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tyrosine receptor kinase 
      (TrkB)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signaling, thereby improving 
      spatial memory deficits in rats under SD. METHODS: In vivo, Morris water maze 
      (MWM) was used to detect the effect of EA on learning and memory, at the same 
      time Western blotting (WB), immunofluorescence (IF), and transmission electron 
      microscopy (TEM) were used to explore the plasticity of hippocampal neurons and 
      synapses, and the expression of BDNF/TrkB/Erk signaling. In vitro, cultured 
      hippocampal neurons were treated with exogenous BDNF and the TrkB inhibitor K252a 
      to confirm the relationship between BDNF/TrkB/Erk signaling and synaptic 
      plasticity. RESULTS: Our results showed that EA mitigated the loss of hippocampal 
      neurons and synapses, stimulated hippocampal neurogenesis, and improved learning 
      and memory of rats under SD accompanied by upregulation of BDNF and increased 
      phosphorylation of TrkB and Erk. In cultured hippocampal neurons, exogenous BDNF 
      enhanced the expression of synaptic proteins, the frequency of the postsynaptic 
      currents, and the phosphorylation of TrkB and Erk; these effects were reversed by 
      treatment with K252a. CONCLUSIONS: Electroacupuncture alleviates SD-induced 
      spatial memory impairment by promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic 
      plasticity via activation of BDNF/TrkB/Erk signaling, which provided evidence for 
      EA as a therapeutic strategy for countering the adverse effects of SD on 
      cognition.

TI  - Human pluripotent stem cell-derived ectomesenchymal stromal cells promote more 
      robust functional recovery than umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells 
      after hypoxic-ischaemic brain damage.
PG  - 143-166
LID - 10.7150/thno.57234 [doi]
AB  - Aims: Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the most serious 
      complications in neonates and infants. Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based 
      therapy is emerging as a promising treatment avenue for HIE. However, despite its 
      enormous potential, the clinical application of MSCs is limited by cell 
      heterogeneity, low isolation efficiency and unpredictable effectiveness. In this 
      study, we examined the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of human 
      pluripotent stem cell-derived ectomesenchymal stromal cells (hPSC-EMSCs) in a rat 
      model of HIE. Methods: hPSC-EMSCs were induced from either human embryonic stem 
      cells or induced pluripotent stem cells. Stem cells or the conditioned medium 
      (CM) derived from stem cells were delivered intracranially or intranasally to 
      neonatal rats with HIE. Human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (hUC-MSCs) were used as 
      the therapeutic comparison control and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used 
      as a negative control. Lesion size, apoptosis, neurogenesis, astrogliosis and 
      microgliosis were evaluated. The rotarod test and Morris water maze were used to 
      determine brain functional recovery. The PC-12 cell line, rat primary cortical 
      neurons and neural progenitor cells were used to evaluate neurite outgrowth and 
      the neuroprotective and neurogenesis effects of hPSC-EMSCs/hUC-MSCs. RNA-seq and 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to determine the secretory factors 
      that were differentially expressed between hPSC-EMSCs and hUC-MSCs. The 
      activation and suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and 
      cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were characterised using western 
      blotting and immunofluorescent staining. Results: hPSC-EMSCs showed a higher 
      neuroprotective potential than hUC-MSCs, as demonstrated by a more significant 
      reduction in lesion size and apoptosis in the rat brain following 
      hypoxia-ischaemia (HI). Compared with PBS treatment, hPSC-EMSCs promoted 
      endogenous neurogenesis and alleviated astrogliosis and microgliosis. hPSC-EMSCs 
      were more effective than hUC-MSCs. hPSC-EMSCs achieved a greater recovery of 
      brain function than hUC-MSCs and PBS in rats with HIE. CM derived from hPSC-EMSCs 
      had neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects in vitro through anti-apoptotic 
      and neurite outgrowth- and neurogenesis-promoting effects. Direct comparisons 
      between hPSC-EMSCs and hUC-MSCs revealed the significant enrichment of a group of 
      secretory factors in hPSC-EMSCs, including nerve growth factor (NGF), 
      platelet-derived growth factor-AA and transforming growth factor-β(2), which are 
      involved in neurogenesis, synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter transport, 
      respectively. Mechanistically, the CM derived from hPSC-EMSCs was found to 
      potentiate NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and the neuronal differentiation of NPCs 
      via the ERK/CREB pathway. Suppression of ERK or CREB abolished CM-potentiated 
      neuritogenesis and neuronal differentiation. Finally, intranasal delivery of the 
      CM derived from hPSC-EMSCs significantly reduced brain lesion size, promoted 
      endogenous neurogenesis, mitigated inflammatory responses and improved functional 
      recovery in rats with HIE. Conclusion: hPSC-EMSCs promote functional recovery 
      after HI through multifaceted neuromodulatory activities via paracrine/trophic 
      mechanisms. We propose the use of hPSC-EMSCs for the treatment of HIE, as they 
      offer an excellent unlimited cellular source of MSCs.

TI  - Proteomics-Guided Study on Buyang Huanwu Decoction for Its Neuroprotective and 
      Neurogenic Mechanisms for Transient Ischemic Stroke: Involvements of 
      EGFR/PI3K/Akt/Bad/14-3-3 and Jak2/Stat3/Cyclin D1 Signaling Cascades.

AB  - Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BHD), a classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) 
      formula, has been used for recovering neurological dysfunctions and treating 
      post-stroke disability in China for 200 years. In the present study, we 
      investigated the effects of BHD on inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, promoting 
      proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurite 
      formation and enhancing learning and memory functional recovery in an 
      experimental rat ischemic stroke model. BHD significantly reduced infarct volume 
      and decreased cell apoptosis in the ischemic brain. BHD enhanced neuronal cell 
      viability in vitro. BHD dose-dependently promoted the proliferation of NSCs in 
      ischemic rat brains in vivo. Moreover, BHD promoted neuronal and astrocyte 
      differentiation in primary cultured NSCs in vitro. Water maze test revealed that 
      BHD promoted the recovery of learning function but not memory functions in the 
      transient ischemic rats. We then investigated the changes of the cellular 
      signaling molecules by using two-dimension (2D) gel electrophoresis and focused 
      on the PI3K/Akt/Bad and Jak2/Stat3/cyclin D1signaling pathway to uncover its 
      underlying mechanisms for its neuroprotective and neurogenetic effects. BHD 
      significantly upregulated the expression of p-PI3K, p-Akt, and p-Bad as well as 
      the expression of p-Jak, p-Stat3, and cyclin D1 in vitro and in vivo. In 
      addition, BHD upregulated Hes1 and downregulated cav-1 in vitro and in vivo. 
      Taken together, these results suggest that BHD has neuroprotective effects and 
      neurogenesis-promoting effects via activating PI3K/Akt/Bad and Jak2/Stat3/Cyclin 
      D1 signaling pathways. Graphical Abstract Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BHD) activates 
      the PI3K-AKT-BAD pathway in the ischemic brain for neuroprotection. BHD also 
      activates JAK2/STAT3/Cyclin D1 signaling cascades for promoting neurogenesis in 
      the hippocampus of post-ischemic brains. Moreover, BHD inhibits the expression of 
      caveolin-1 and increases the expression of HES1 for promoting neuronal 
      differentiation. The neuroprotective and neurogenesis-promoting effects in the 
      hippocampus of post-ischemic brains promote learning ability.

AB  - Here, we have unveiled the effects of cycloastragenol against Aβ 
      (Amyloid-beta)-induced oxidative stress, neurogenic dysfunction, activated 
      mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and mitochondrial apoptosis in an 
      Aβ-induced mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Aβ-induced mouse model 
      was developed by the stereotaxic injection of amyloid-beta (5 
      μg/mouse/intracerebroventricular), and cycloastragenol was given at a dose of 20 
      mg/kg/day/p.o for 6 weeks daily. For the biochemical analysis, we used 
      immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Our findings showed that the injection 
      of Aβ elevated oxidative stress and reduced the expression of neurogenic markers, 
      as shown by the reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
      and the phosphorylation of its specific receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B 
      (p-TrKB). In addition, there was a marked reduction in the expression of NeuN 
      (neuronal nuclear protein) in the Aβ-injected mice brains (cortex and 
      hippocampus). Interestingly, the expression of Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 
      2-related factor 2), HO-1 (heme oxygenase-1), p-TrKB, BDNF, and NeuN was markedly 
      enhanced in the Aβ + Cycloastragenol co-treated mice brains. We have also 
      evaluated the expressions of MAP kinases such as phospho c-Jun-N-terminal kinase 
      (p-JNK), p-38, and phospho-extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2) in the 
      experimental groups, which suggested that the expression of p-JNK, p-P-38, and 
      p-Erk were significantly upregulated in the Aβ-injected mice brains; 
      interestingly, these markers were downregulated in the Aβ + Cycloastragenol 
      co-treated mice brains. We also checked the expression of activated microglia and 
      inflammatory cytokines, which showed that cycloastragenol reduced the activated 
      microglia and inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, we evaluated the effects of 
      cycloastragenol against mitochondrial apoptosis and memory dysfunctions in the 
      experimental groups. The findings showed significant regulatory effects against 
      apoptosis and memory dysfunction as revealed by the Morris water maze (MWM) test. 
      Collectively, the findings suggested that cycloastragenol regulates oxidative 
      stress, neurotrophic processes, neuroinflammation, apoptotic cell death, and 
      memory impairment in the mouse model of AD.

TI  - MiR-124 Enriched Exosomes Promoted the M2 Polarization of Microglia and Enhanced 
      Hippocampus Neurogenesis After Traumatic Brain Injury by Inhibiting TLR4 Pathway.
PG  - 811-828
LID - 10.1007/s11064-018-02714-z [doi]
AB  - MicroRNA-124 (miR-124) is a brain specific miRNA that is highly expressed in 
      microglia. The upregulation of miR-124 contributes to M2 polarization of 
      microglia, which is beneficial to neurogenesis. Exosomes are lipid membrane 
      vesicles that can deliver miR-124 into the brain. However, whether miR-124 
      enriched exosomes (Exo-miR-124) can regulate the polarization of microglia and 
      affect hippocampus neurogenesis after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is unknown. To 
      clarify this, the Exo-miR-124 was first constructed, and then was intravenously 
      administrated into rats via tail vein with the dose of 3 × 10(9) particles/each 
      rat at 24 h post TBI. The polarization of microglia in hippocampus was evaluated 
      through measuring the signature genes and cytokines of M1/M2 phenotype by reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immune sorbent 
      assay (ELISA) at 7/14/21/28 days after TBI. Hippocampus neurogenesis was 
      evaluated through detecting the proliferation marker BrdU/SOX2 and 
      differentiation marker BrdU/NeuN by immunofluorescence (IF) at 7 and 28 days 
      after TBI respectively. Neurological function was evaluated by neurological 
      severity score (NSS) and morris water maze (MWM) at 7/14/21/28 and 24-28 days 
      after TBI respectively. To explore the underlying mechanisms, the mRNA expression 
      of TLR4 pathway molecules in hippocampus were measured by RT-PCR, and the 
      polarization of microglia and the activation of TLR4 pathway in BV2 cells were 
      measured after exosome treatment as well. Results demonstrated that Exo-miR-124 
      treatment promoted the M2 polarization of microglia, enhanced neurogenesis in 
      hippocampus, and improved function recovery after TBI. The M2 polarization effect 
      of Exo-miR-124 was produced through inhibiting TLR4 pathway, which was verified 
      in hippocampus and BV2 microglia. In conclusion, Exo-miR-124 treatment promoted 
      M2 polarization of microglia and improved hippocampal neurogenesis and functional 
      recovery after brain injury, which might be a strategy to improve the outcome of 
      TBI.

TI  - Effects of Involuntary and Voluntary Exercise in Combination with Acousto-Optic 
      Stimulation on Adult Neurogenesis in an Alzheimer's Mouse Model.
PG  - 3254-3279
LID - 10.1007/s12035-022-02784-9 [doi]
AB  - Single-factor intervention, such as physical exercise and auditory and visual 
      stimulation, plays a positive role on the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD); however, the therapeutic effects of single-factor intervention are 
      limited. The beneficial effects of these multifactor combinations on AD and its 
      molecular mechanism have yet to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effect 
      of multifactor intervention, voluntary wheel exercise, and involuntary treadmill 
      running in combination with acousto-optic stimulation, on adult neurogenesis and 
      behavioral phenotypes in a mouse model of AD. We found that 4 weeks of 
      multifactor intervention can significantly increase the production of newborn 
      cells (BrdU(+) cells) and immature neurons (DCX(+) cells) in the hippocampus and 
      lateral ventricle of Aβ oligomer-induced mice. Importantly, the multifactor 
      intervention could promote BrdU(+) cells to differentiate into neurons (BrdU(+) 
      DCX(+) cells or BrdU(+) NeuN(+) cells) and astrocytes (BrdU(+)GFAP(+) cells) in 
      the hippocampus and ameliorate Aβ oligomer-induced cognitive impairment and 
      anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in mice evaluated by novel object 
      recognition, Morris water maze tests, elevated zero maze, forced swimming test, 
      and tail suspension test, respectively. Moreover, multifactor intervention could 
      lead to an increase in the protein levels of PSD-95, SYP, DCX, NeuN, GFAP, Bcl-2, 
      BDNF, TrkB, and pSer473-Akt and a decrease in the protein levels of BAX and 
      caspase-9 in the hippocampal lysates of Aβ oligomer-induced mice. Furthermore, 
      sequencing analysis of serum metabolites revealed that aberrantly expressed 
      metabolites modulated by multifactor intervention were highly enriched in the 
      biological process associated with keeping neurons functioning and 
      neurobehavioral function. Additionally, the intervention-mediated serum 
      metabolites mainly participated in glutamate metabolism, glucose metabolism, and 
      the tricarboxylic acid cycle in mice. Our findings suggest the potential of 
      multifactor intervention as a non-invasive therapeutic strategy for AD to anti-Aβ 
      oligomer neurotoxicity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) is a demethylating agent that has 
      various biological effects related to DNA methylation. DNA methylation plays 
      important roles in learning and memory. We have reported that 5-Aza-CdR improved 
      the performance of mice in the water maze and step-down tests. Some behaviours 
      have been well recognized to be mediated by neurogenesis in the hippocampus. The 
      Notch signalling pathway plays a key role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In 
      this study, we examined whether 5-Aza-CdR (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) 
      affects neurogenesis and Notch1 expression. METHODS: The learning and memory 
      behaviour of mice was evaluated by a conditioned avoidance learning 24 h after 
      5-Aza-CdR treatment. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Notch1 and HES1 
      were measured by real-time PCR and Western blotting. The 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine 
      (BrdU)-positive cells and the expression of Notch1 in the hippocampal DG were 
      observed through laser confocal microscopy. To further clarify whether 5-Aza-CdR 
      affects behaviour through neurogenesis, the expression level of Notch1, cell 
      viability and cell cycle were analysed using the HT22 cell line. RESULTS: The 
      behaviour in conditioned avoidance learning was improved, while neurogenesis and 
      the Notch1 pathway were increased in the hippocampus of mice that were injected 
      with 5-Aza-CdR. In vitro experiments showed that 5-Aza-CdR increased the 
      expression of the Notch1 pathway and upregulated S-phase in the cell cycle and 
      cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the effect of 5-Aza-CdR on 
      behaviour may be related to an increase in neurogenesis with upregulation of the 
      Notch1 pathway in the hippocampus.

AB  - Currently, it is controversially discussed whether a relationship between obesity 
      and cognition exists. We here analyzed a mouse model of obesity (leptin-deficient 
      mice) to study the effects of obesity on the morphology of the hippocampus (a 
      brain structure involved in mechanisms related to learning and memory) and on 
      behavior. Mice aged 4 to 6 months were analyzed. At this age, the obese mice have 
      nearly double the body weight as controls, but display smaller brains (brain 
      volume is about 10% smaller) as control animals of the same age. Adult 
      hippocampal neurogenesis, a process that is linked to learning and memory, might 
      be disturbed in the obese mice and contribute to the smaller brain volume. Adult 
      hippocampal neurogenesis was examined using specific markers for cell 
      proliferation (phosphohistone H3), neuronal differentiation (doublecortin), and 
      apoptosis (caspase 3). The number of phosphohistone H3 and doublecortin-positive 
      cells was markedly reduced in leptin-deficient mice, but not the number of 
      apoptotic cells, indicating that adult hippocampal neurogenesis on the level of 
      cell proliferation was affected. In addition, dendritic spine densities of 
      pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal area CA1 were analyzed using Golgi 
      impregnation. However, no significant change in dendritic spine densities was 
      noted in the obese mice. Moreover, the performance of the mice was analyzed in 
      the open field as well as in the Morris water maze. In the open field test, obese 
      mice showed reduced locomotor activity, but in the Morris water maze they showed 
      similar performance compared with control animals.

TI  - Sex Differences in the Spatial Behavior Functions of Adult-Born Neurons in Rats.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis modifies hippocampal circuits and behavior, but removing 
      newborn neurons does not consistently alter spatial processing, a core function 
      of the hippocampus. Additionally, little is known about sex differences in 
      neurogenesis since few studies have compared males and females. Since adult-born 
      neurons regulate the stress response, we hypothesized that spatial functions may 
      be more prominent under aversive conditions and may differ between males and 
      females given sex differences in stress responding. We therefore trained intact 
      and neurogenesis-deficient rats in the spatial water maze at temperatures that 
      vary in their degree of aversiveness. In the standard water maze, ablating 
      neurogenesis did not alter spatial learning in either sex. However, in cold 
      water, ablating neurogenesis had divergent sex-dependent effects: relative to 
      intact rats, male neurogenesis-deficient rats were slower to escape the maze and 
      female neurogenesis-deficient rats were faster. Neurogenesis promoted 
      temperature-related changes in search strategy in females, but it promoted search 
      strategy stability in males. Females displayed greater recruitment (Fos 
      expression) of the dorsal hippocampus than males, particularly in cold water. 
      However, blocking neurogenesis did not alter Fos expression in either sex. 
      Finally, morphologic analyses revealed greater experience-dependent plasticity in 
      males. Adult-born neurons in males and females had similar morphology at baseline 
      but training increased spine density and reduced presynaptic terminal size, 
      specifically in males. Collectively, these findings indicate that adult-born 
      neurons contribute to spatial learning in stressful conditions and they provide 
      new evidence for sex differences in their behavioral functions.

TI  - Daily Consumption of High-Polyphenol Olive Oil Enhances Hippocampal Neurogenesis 
      in Old Female Rats.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1080/27697061.2022.2144540 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of daily consumption 
      of high-polyphenol (HP) olive oil on neurogenesis by investigating neuronal cell 
      proliferation and maturation in the hippocampus of old rats, and to evaluate the 
      relationship between neurogenesis, spatial memory, and anxiety-like behavior. 
      METHODS: A total of 34 female, 20-22-month-old Sprague Dawley rats were divided 
      into three groups: control group, low-polyphenol (LP) group, and high-polyphenol 
      (HP) group. The animals were fed distilled water, LP olive oil and HP-extra 
      virgin olive oil, respectively for 6 weeks using an oral gavage. At 43 days, 
      animals were tested using the Morris Water Maze to evaluate spatial memory, and 
      the Open-field test to evaluate anxiety-like behavior. Neural cell proliferation 
      in the dentate gyrus (DG) was determined by BrdU labeling and Nestin protein 
      expression. Neuronal maturation was determined by NeuN labeling. Synaptic density 
      in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex was examined by measuring Synaptophysin 
      (SYN) levels. Hippocampal Calbindin levels were measured to assess cellular 
      calcium metabolism. RESULTS: Daily consumption of HP olive oil significantly 
      improved cell proliferation and neuronal maturation in the DG of old rats. 
      HP-olive oil significantly increased SYN levels in the prefrontal cortex, and 
      nestin and calbindin levels in the hippocampus (p < 0.05). LP olive oil diet has 
      shown no effect on any parameter (p > 0.05). We also did not find any 
      statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of spatial 
      memory and anxiety-like behavior (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study is first to 
      show that daily consumption of HP-olive oil enhances hippocampal neurogenesis in 
      old rats, which has been confirmed by proliferation and maturation biomarkers. In 
      addition, increased SYN and calbindin levels showed that the generated cells were 
      also functionally developed in the HP group. We suggest that daily consumption of 
      HP olive oil may have beneficial effects on brain aging by triggering 
      neurogenesis.

TI  - Progranulin promotes hippocampal neurogenesis and alleviates anxiety-like 
      behavior and cognitive impairment in adult mice subjected to cerebral ischemia.
PG  - 775-787
LID - 10.1111/cns.13810 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Cerebral ischemia can lead to anxiety and cognitive impairment due to the 
      loss of hippocampal neurons. Facilitation of endogenous neurogenesis in the 
      hippocampus is a potential therapeutic strategy for alleviating ischemia-induced 
      anxiety and cognitive impairment. Progranulin (PGRN), a secretory glycoprotein, 
      has been reported to have a mitogentic effect on many cell types. However, it is 
      not clear whether PGRN enhances hippocampal neurogenesis and promotes functional 
      recovery. METHODS: Adult male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to permanent middle 
      cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) and injected intracerebroventricularly with 
      recombinant mouse PGRN 30 min after pMCAO. Anxiety-like behavior was detected by 
      the open field and the elevated plus maze tests, and spatial learning and memory 
      abilities were evaluated by Morris water maze. Neurogenesis was examined by 
      double labeling of BrdU and neural stem cells or neurons markers. For mechanism 
      studies, the level of ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation were assessed by western 
      blotting. RESULTS: Progranulin significantly alleviated anxiety-like behavior and 
      spatial learning and memory impairment induced by cerebral ischemia in mice. 
      Consistent with the functional recovery, PGRN promoted neural stem cells (NSCs) 
      proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus (DG) after 
      cerebral ischemia. PGRN upregulated the expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and 
      Akt in the DG after cerebral ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: Progranulin alleviates 
      ischemia-induced anxiety-like behavior and spatial learning and memory impairment 
      in mice, probably via stimulation of hippocampal neurogenesis mediated by 
      activation of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. PGRN might be a promising candidate 
      for coping with ischemic stroke-induced mood and cognitive impairment in clinic.

AB  - Some reports have described that a high fructose diet is associated with a 
      deficit of hippocampus-dependent cognitive functions. In this study, we have 
      evaluated the effects of fructose on spatial memory and molecular markers in the 
      hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and analyzed whether those alterations are 
      reversible. Male Wistar rats (n = 60) began their treatment during adolescence. A 
      group was forced to drink a solution of 10% fructose for twelve weeks. Another 
      group was subjected to the same fructose intake schedule, but later fructose was 
      removed, and tap water was provided for four weeks. After treatments, spatial 
      memory was evaluated with Barnes maze. Different neurogenesis, inflammation, 
      astrocyte, and energy homeostasis markers were evaluated with immunofluorescence, 
      ELISA, and Western blot. Changes were analyzed using two-way repeated-measures 
      ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, and Tukeýs posthoc test (p < 0.05). Results showed that 
      after long-term consumption of fructose, there was an impairment of spatial 
      memory. This deficit was concomitant with the abolition of hippocampal 
      neurogenesis and significant increases of IL-1b in the hippocampus and prefrontal 
      cortex. Levels of COX-2 were decreased in the hippocampus. Besides, fructose 
      induced a significant increase in GFAP and a decrease of glutamine synthetase. 
      Likewise, energy homeostasis-associated neuropeptide orexin-A and their receptors 
      (ORX R1 and ORX R2) were significantly increased. The spatial memory deficit, 
      neuroinflammation, and changes in some proteinś expression were permanent one 
      month after the fructose elimination from the diet. These results suggest that 
      fructose induces substantial hippocampal and cortical changes, and those are 
      irreversible after a shift in the diet.

AB  - Estrogen receptors (ERs) are thought to be associated with the onset and 
      progression of neurodegenerative injuries and diseases, but the relationship and 
      mechanisms underlying between ERs and cognition in type 2 diabetes remain 
      elusive. In the current study, we investigated the effects of ERα and ERβ on the 
      cognition, neurogenesis and apoptosis in high-fat diet and streptozocin-induced 
      diabetic mice. We found that ERα and/or ERβ activation using their agonists 
      (0.5 mg/kg E2, PPT or DPN) ameliorate memory impairment in the Morris water maze 
      and Y-maze tests, increase hippocampal neurogenesis and prevent hippocampal 
      apoptotic responses. Importantly, treatment with the pharmacologic ERs agonists 
      caused significant increases in the membrane ERα and ERβ expression and 
      subsequent PI3K/Akt, CREB and BDNF activation in the hippocampus of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus mice. Our data indicate that ERα and ERβ are involved in the 
      cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes, and that activated ERs, such as 
      application of ERs agonists, could be a novel and promising strategy for the 
      treatment of diabetic cognitive impairment.

TI  - The role of GFAP and vimentin in learning and memory.
PG  - 1147-1156
LID - 10.1515/hsz-2019-0199 [doi]
AB  - Intermediate filaments (also termed nanofilaments) are involved in many cellular 
      functions and play important roles in cellular responses to stress. The 
      upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin (Vim), 
      intermediate filament proteins of astrocytes, is the hallmark of astrocyte 
      activation and reactive gliosis in response to injury, ischemia or 
      neurodegeneration. Reactive gliosis is essential for the protective role of 
      astrocytes at acute stages of neurotrauma or ischemic stroke. However, GFAP and 
      Vim were also linked to neural plasticity and regenerative responses in healthy 
      and injured brain. Mice deficient for GFAP and vimentin (GFAP-/-Vim-/-) exhibit 
      increased post-traumatic synaptic plasticity and increased basal and 
      post-traumatic hippocampal neurogenesis. Here we assessed the locomotor and 
      exploratory behavior of GFAP-/-Vim-/- mice, their learning, memory and memory 
      extinction, by using the open field, object recognition and Morris water maze 
      tests, trace fear conditioning, and by recording reversal learning in 
      IntelliCages. While the locomotion, exploratory behavior and learning of 
      GFAP-/-Vim-/- mice, as assessed by object recognition, the Morris water maze, and 
      trace fear conditioning tests, were comparable to wildtype mice, GFAP-/-Vim-/- 
      mice showed more pronounced memory extinction when tested in IntelliCages, a 
      finding compatible with the scenario of an increased rate of reorganization of 
      the hippocampal circuitry.

TI  - Dexmedetomidine Promotes Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Improves Spatial Learning 
      and Memory in Neonatal Rats.
PG  - 4439-4449
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S228220 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine (Dex) is a highly selective α2-adrenoceptor agonist 
      used as an off-label medication for pediatric sedation and analgesia. Recently, 
      Dex was reported to exhibit neuroprotective efficacy in several brain injury 
      models. Here we investigate whether neonatal Dex administration promotes 
      hippocampal neurogenesis and enhances hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and 
      memory under physiological conditions. METHODS: Postnatal day 7 (P7) pups were 
      administered saline (vehicle control) or Dex (10, 20, or 40 µg/kg) by 
      intraperitoneal injection. Neurogenesis and astrogenesis were examined in brain 
      slices by BrdU immunostaining on P8 and changes in the expression levels of GDNF, 
      NCAM, CREB, PSD95, and GAP43 were assessed by Western blotting on P35, 
      respectively. Open field and Morris water maze (MWM) tests were conducted from 
      P28 to P36 in order to assess effects on general motor activity and spatial 
      learning, respectively. RESULTS: Dexmedetomidine at 20 µg/kg significantly 
      enhanced neurogenesis and astrogenesis in hippocampus and upregulated GDNF, NCAM, 
      CREB, PSD95, and GAP43 compared to vehicle and other Dex doses. Moreover, 20 
      µg/kg Dex-injected rats showed no changes in motor or anxiety-like behavior but 
      performed better in the MWM test compared to all other groups. CONCLUSION: 
      Neonatal injection of Dex (20 µg/kg) enhances spatial learning and memory in rat 
      pups, potentially by promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity 
      via activation of GDNF/NCAM/CREB signaling.

AB  - Much attention has recently been focused on nutraceuticals, with minimal adverse 
      effects, developed for preventing or treating neurological diseases such as 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study was conducted to investigate the 
      potential effect on neural development and function of the microalgae 
      Aurantiochytrium sp. as a nutraceutical. To test neuroprotection by the ethanol 
      extract of Aurantiochytrium (EEA) and a derivative, the n-Hexane layer of EEA 
      (HEEA), amyloid-β-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells, was used as an in vitro AD model. We 
      then assessed the potential enhancement of neurogenesis by EEA and HEEA using 
      murine ex vivo neurospheres. We also administered EEA or HEEA to 
      senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice, a non-transgenic strain with 
      accelerated aging and AD-like memory loss for evaluation of spatial learning and 
      memory using the Morris water maze test. Finally, we performed 
      immunohistochemical analysis for assessment of neurogenesis in mice administered 
      EEA. Pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with EEA or the squalene-rich fraction of EEA, 
      HEEA, ameliorated amyloid-β-induced cytotoxicity. Interestingly, only EEA-treated 
      cells showed a significant increase in cell metabolism and intracellular 
      adenosine triphosphate production. Moreover, EEA treatment significantly 
      increased the number of neurospheres, whereas HEEA treatment significantly 
      increased the number of β-III-tubulin+ young neurons and GFAP+ astrocytes. SAMP8 
      mice were given 50 mg/kg EEA or HEEA orally for 30 days. EEA and HEEA decreased 
      escape latency in the Morris water maze in SAMP8 mice, indicating improved 
      memory. To detect stem cells and newborn neurons, we administered BrdU for 9 days 
      and measured BrdU+ cells in the dentate gyrus, a neurogenic stem cell niche of 
      the hippocampus. In SAMP8 mice, EEA rapidly and significantly increased the 
      number of BrdU+GFAP+ stem cells and their progeny, BrdU+NeuN+ mature neurons. In 
      conclusion, our data in aggregate indicate that EEA and its constituents could be 
      developed into a nutraceutical for promoting brain health and function against 
      several age-related diseases, particularly AD.

AB  - Investigations using preclinical models of preterm birth have much contributed, 
      together with human neuropathological studies, for advances in our understanding 
      of preterm brain injury. Here, we evaluated whether the neurodevelopmental and 
      behavioral consequences of preterm birth induced by a non-inflammatory model of 
      preterm birth using mifepristone would differ from those after inflammatory 
      prenatal transient hypoxia-ischemia (TSHI) model. Pregnant Wistar rats were 
      either injected with mifepristone, and pups were delivered on embryonic day 21 
      (ED21 group), or laparotomized on the 18th day of gestation for 60 min of uterine 
      arteries occlusion. Rat pups were tested postnatally for characterization of 
      developmental milestones and, after weaning, they were behaviorally tested for 
      anxiety and for spatial learning and memory. One month later, brains were 
      processed for quantification of doublecortin (DCX)- and neuropeptide Y 
      (NPY)-immunoreactive cells, and cholinergic varicosities in the hippocampus. ED21 
      rats did not differ from controls with respect to neonatal developmental 
      milestones, anxiety, learning and memory functions, and neurochemical parameters. 
      Conversely, in TSHI rats the development of neonatal reflexes was delayed, the 
      levels of anxiety were reduced, and spatial learning and memory was impaired; in 
      the hippocampus, the total number of DCX and NPY cells was increased, and the 
      density of cholinergic varicosities was reduced. With these results we suggest 
      that a preterm birth, in a non-inflammatory prenatal environment, does not 
      significantly change neonatal development and adult neurologic outcome. On other 
      hand, prenatal hypoxia and ischemia (inflammation) modifies developmental 
      trajectory, learning and memory, neurogenesis, and NPY GABAergic and cholinergic 
      brain systems.

TI  - Dimethyl Fumarate Alleviates Adult Neurogenesis Disruption in Hippocampus and 
      Olfactory Bulb and Spatial Cognitive Deficits Induced by Intracerebroventricular 
      Streptozotocin Injection in Young and Aged Rats.
LID - 10.3390/ijms232415449 [doi]

AB  - The disorder of adult neurogenesis is considered an important mechanism 
      underlying the learning and memory impairment observed in Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD). The sporadic nonhereditary form of AD (sAD) affects over 95% of AD patients 
      and is related to interactions between genetic and environmental factors. An 
      intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ-ICV) is a representative 
      and well-established method to induce sAD-like pathology. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) 
      has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and is used for multiple 
      sclerosis treatment. The present study determines whether a 26-day DMF therapy 
      ameliorates the disruption of adult neurogenesis and BDNF-related neuroprotection 
      in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb (OB) in an STZ-ICV rat model of sAD. 
      Considering age as an important risk factor for developing AD, this study was 
      performed using 3-month-old (the young group) and 22-month-old (the aged group) 
      male Wistar rats. Spatial cognitive functions were evaluated with the Morris 
      water maze task. Immunofluorescent labelling was used to assess the parameters of 
      adult neurogenesis and BDNF-related neuroprotection in the hippocampus and OB. 
      Our results showed that the STZ-ICV evoked spatial learning and memory impairment 
      and disturbances in adult neurogenesis and BDNF expression in both examined brain 
      structures. In the aged animals, the deficits were more severe. We found that the 
      DMF treatment significantly alleviated STZ-ICV-induced behavioural and neuronal 
      disorders in both age groups of the rats. Our findings suggest that DMF, due to 
      its beneficial effect on the formation of new neurons and BDNF-related 
      neuroprotection, may be considered as a promising new therapeutic agent in human 
      sAD.

AB  - Presbycusis contributes to cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. However, 
      most research in this area involves clinical observations and statistical 
      modeling, and few studies have examined the relationship between hearing loss and 
      the molecular changes that lead to cognitive dysfunction. The present study 
      investigated whether hearing loss contributes to dementia in the absence of aging 
      and noise using a mouse model of severe bilateral hearing loss induced by 
      kanamycin (1000 mg/kg) and furosemide (400 mg/kg). Immunohistochemistry, silver 
      staining, immunofluorescence analysis, and Western blotting were used to observe 
      pathological changes in different regions of the hippocampus in animals with 
      hearing loss. Changes in the cognitive function of animals with hearing loss were 
      assessed using the Morris water maze test. The results showed that neurons began 
      to degenerate 60 days after hearing loss, and this degeneration was accompanied 
      by structural disorganization and decreased neurogenesis. The level of 
      phosphorylated tau increased over time. Increases in escape latency and distance 
      traveled during the training phase of the Morris water maze test were observed 
      90 days after hearing loss. Activated microglia and astrocytes with increased 
      levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and 
      interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were detected in the hippocampus. These results suggest 
      that hearing loss alone causes neuronal degeneration, inhibition of neurogenesis, 
      increased tau protein phosphorylation, and increased neuroinflammation in the 
      hippocampus. Early intervention in individuals with hearing loss may reduce the 
      risk of cognitive decline.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a multidimensional condition that is treatable by the 
      restoration of a lean phenotype; however, some obesity-related outcomes may 
      persist after weight normalization. Among the organs of the human body, the brain 
      possesses a relatively low regenerative capacity and could retain perturbations 
      established as a result of developmental obesity. Calorie restriction (CR) or a 
      restricted ketogenic diet (KD) are successfully used as weight loss approaches, 
      but their impact on obesity-related effects in the brain have not been previously 
      evaluated. METHODS: We performed a series of experiments in a rat model of 
      developmental obesity induced by a 12-week cafeteria diet, followed by CR to 
      implement weight loss. First, we assessed the impact of obesity on neurogenesis 
      (BrdU incorporation into the hippocampus), cognitive function (water maze), and 
      concomitant changes in hippocampal protein expression (GC/MS-MS, western blot). 
      Next, we repeated these experiments in a rat model of weight loss induced by CR. 
      We also measured mitochondrial enzyme activity in rats after weight loss during 
      the fed or fasting state. This study was extended by additional experiments with 
      restricted KD used as a weight loss approach in order to compare the efficacy of 
      two different nutritional interventions used in the treatment of obesity on 
      hippocampal functions. By using a modified version of the water maze we evaluated 
      cognitive abilities in rats subjected to weight loss by CR or a restricted KD. 
      RESULTS: In this study, obesity affected metabolic processes, upregulated 
      hippocampal NF-κB, and induced proteomic differences which were associated with 
      impaired cognition and neurogenesis. Weight loss improved neurogenesis and 
      enhanced cognition. While the expression pattern of some proteins persisted after 
      weight loss, most of the changes appeared de novo revealing metabolic adjustment 
      by overactivation of citrate synthase and downregulation of ATP synthase. As a 
      consequence of fasting, the activity of these enzymes indicated hippocampal 
      adaptation to negative energy balance during the weight loss phase of CR. 
      Moreover, the effects on cognitive abilities measured after weight loss were 
      negatively correlated with the animal weight measured at the final stage of 
      weight gain. This was alleviated by KD, which improved cognition when used as a 
      weight loss approach. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that cognition and 
      mitochondrial metabolism in the hippocampus are affected by CR- or KD-induced 
      weight loss.

AB  - This study aimed to determine whether preemptive fentanyl administration in 
      neonatal rats reduces the impact of a nociceptive stimulus initiated during the 
      first day of life (P1) on hippocampal neurogenesis, behavior, and learning. At 
      P1, Wistar rat pups received either a subcutaneous injection of fentanyl (F) 
      before intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (CFA + F 
      group), an isolated injection of CFA (CFA group), or subcutaneous injection of 
      fentanyl without CFA injection (F). Control animals received saline injections 
      using the same route and volume as the treatment groups. Hippocampal neurogenesis 
      was evaluated by 5' -bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) staining on P10 and P39 to 
      assess neuronal proliferation and survival, respectively. Anxiety behavior in 
      adulthood was assessed using an open field test (OF) and an elevated plus maze 
      test (EPM). Spatial memory was assessed on a Morris water maze test (MWM), where 
      the animals were trained for seven days, beginning on P81, and the probe trial 
      was performed to evaluate memory retention. Although the CFA + F group showed an 
      increased number of proliferative cells on P10, this finding did not persist on 
      P39. The CFA + F group spent more time in the closed arms in the EPM, revealing 
      more anxious behavior, although the early noxious experience, both with and 
      without fentanyl, did not alter neurogenesis in adolescence and learning in 
      adulthood. This study highlights that the impact of pain in early life pain 
      combined with fentanyl on hippocampal neurogenesis on P10 did not persist on P39. 
      In addition, this combined intervention during the first week of life was 
      associated with higher anxiety levels.

LID - 10.3233/JAD-215016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), with cognitive impairment as the main 
      clinical manifestation, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. The assembly 
      of amyloid-β (Aβ) as senile plaques is one of the most well-known 
      histopathological alterations in AD. Several studies reported that cognitive 
      training reduced Aβ deposition and delayed memory loss. However, the long-term 
      benefits of spatial training and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms have 
      not yet been elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To explore the long-term effects of spatial 
      training on AD-related pathogenic processes in APP/PS1 mice. METHODS: We used 
      Morris water maze (MWM), Open Field, Barnes Maze, western blotting, qPCR, and 
      immunofluorescence. RESULTS: One-month MWM training in APP/PS1 mice at 2.5 months 
      of age could attenuate Aβ deposition and decrease the expression of β-secretase 
      (BACE1) and amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) with long-term effects. 
      Simultaneously, regular spatial training increased the expression of 
      synapse-related proteins in the hippocampus. Moreover, MWM training increased 
      adult hippocampal neurogenesis in AD model mice. Nonetheless, cognitive deficits 
      in APP/PS1 transgenic mice at 7 months of age were not attenuated by MWM training 
      at an early stage. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that MWM training 
      alleviates amyloid plaque burden and adult hippocampal neurogenesis deficits with 
      long-term effects in AD model mice.

TI  - Porous Se@SiO(2) Nanoparticles Attenuate Radiation-Induced Cognitive Dysfunction 
      via Modulating Reactive Oxygen Species.
PG  - 1342-1353
LID - 10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c01571 [doi]
AB  - Radiotherapy has been widely used to manage primary and metastatic brain tumors. 
      However, hippocampal damage and subsequent cognitive dysfunction are common 
      complications of whole brain radiation (WBI). In this study, Se@SiO(2) 
      nanoparticles (NPs) with antioxidant properties were synthesized. Se@SiO(2) NPs 
      were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron 
      microscopy (TEM). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging ability of 
      Se@SiO(2) NPs was assessed using a dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate 
      (DCFH-DA) probe. Apoptosis of HT-22 cells treated with H(2)O(2) and Se@SiO(2) NPs 
      was assessed by annexin V-FITC/PI and JC-1 staining. Western blotting was used to 
      evaluate inflammation-related signaling pathways. In vivo, the distribution and 
      excretion of Se@SiO(2) NPs were assessed using in vivo imaging system (IVIS). The 
      biosafety and antioxidant effects of Se@SiO(2) NPs were assessed. Neurogenesis in 
      the hippocampus of mice was detected through neuron-specific nuclear protein 
      (NeuN) and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) immunofluorescence staining. The 
      cognitive abilities of mice were also assessed using the Morris water maze test. 
      Results showed that porous Se@SiO(2) NPs were successfully synthesized with 
      uniform spherical structures. In vitro, Se@SiO(2) NPs inhibited ROS levels in 
      mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line HT-22 treated with H(2)O(2). Furthermore, 
      Se@SiO(2) NPs suppressed the apoptotic rate of HT-22 cells by regulating 
      apoptosis-related proteins. Se@SiO(2) NPs regulated the nuclear factor kappa B 
      (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, thereby 
      reducing the expression of inflammatory factors. In vivo, Se@SiO(2) NPs showed 
      high biocompatibility at a concentration of 1.25 μg/μL. Se@SiO(2) NPs inhibited 
      ROS and promoted neurogenesis in the hippocampus, as well as improved cognitive 
      ability in radiation-induced mice. In conclusion, Se@SiO(2) NPs protected the 
      hippocampus from oxidative stress injury and neuroinflammation. Se@SiO(2) NPs 
      treatment may be a potential therapeutic strategy for radiation-induced cognitive 
      dysfunction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) endangers quality of 
      life in children, and curative attempts are rarely effective. Neurogenesis plays 
      an important role in neural repair following brain damage. This study aimed to 
      investigate the role of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) in neurogenesis 
      after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD). METHODS: Neonatal HIBD 
      models were established in vivo (Sprague-Dawley rats, 7 days old) and in vitro 
      (cultured neural stem cells, NSCs). Lentivirus and adenovirus transfection was 
      used to induce TERT overexpression. Expression of TERT was detected by 
      quantitative real-time PCR and immunofluorescence staining. NSCs apoptosis and 
      proliferation were measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick 
      end labeling (TUNEL) staining and cell counting assays, respectively. Migration 
      and differentiation of NSCs were assessed by western blotting and 
      immunofluorescence staining. Morris water maze test and modified neurological 
      severity scores were conducted to evaluate the neurological function of rats. 
      RESULTS: Overexpression of TERT attenuated apoptosis of NSCs; promoted 
      proliferation, migration, and differentiation of NSCs; and induced myelination in 
      the brains of neonatal rats after HIBD. Moreover, it reduced the impairment of 
      learning, memory, and neurological function after HIBD in neonatal rats. In vitro 
      findings indicated that the expression of Gli1 was increased after OGD, and 
      overexpression of TERT further increased the expression of Gli1 in NSCs after 
      OGD. DISCUSSION: TERT promotes neurogenesis and decreases neurological function 
      injury after HIBD in neonatal rats. This neuroprotective pathway may provide a 
      basis for developing therapeutic strategies for neonatal HIE. Furthermore, TERT 
      may represent a target during neural injury and repair in patients with various 
      diseases affecting the nervous system.

TI  - The Effects and Regulatory Mechanism of Flavonoids from Stems and Leaves of 
      Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi in Promoting Neurogenesis and Improving Memory 
      Impairment Mediated by the BDNF-ERK-CREB Signaling Pathway in Rats.
PG  - 354-366

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well known that Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative 
      disease accompanied by memory impairment and major pathological changes of the 
      extracellular Senile Plaque (SP) and intracellular Neurofibrillary Tangles 
      (NFTs). However, many pieces of evidence indicate that neurogenesis disorders are 
      also regarded as a new opinion in AD. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate 
      the effects and regulatory mechanism of flavonoids from the stems and leaves of 
      Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi in promoting neurogenesis and improving memory 
      impairment mediated by BDNF-ERK-CREB signaling pathway in rats. METHODS: Male 
      Wistar rats were intracerebroventricularly injected with amyloid-beta protein 
      25-35 (Aβ25-35) in combination with Aluminum Trichloride (Alcl3) and recombinant 
      human transforming growth factor-β1 (RHTGF-β1) (composited Aβ), to establish an 
      AD model. Morris water maze was used to screen AD model rats and measure the 
      learning and memory ability of model rats. The expression of Ki67 protein, which 
      is involved in cell neurogenesis, in the hippocampal gyrus of rats was detected 
      by the immunohistochemical method. The mRNA and protein expression levels of 
      Grb2, SOS1, Ras, ERK, and BDNF, in the BDNF-ERK-CREB signaling pathway, in the 
      hippocampus and cerebral cortex regions of rats were assayed by the Quantitative 
      real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting methods, respectively. RESULTS: 
      Intracerebroventricular injection of composited Aβ could induce rats' memory 
      impairment, decrease the protein expression of Ki67 in the hippocampal gyrus, and 
      increase the mRNA and protein expression levels of Grb2, SOS1, Ras, ERK, and BDNF 
      in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. However, SSF could significantly 
      ameliorate rats' memory impairment induced by composited Aβ, lower the Ki67 
      protein expression in the hippocampal gyrus, and regulate the abnormal mRNA and 
      protein expression levels of Grb2, SOS1, Ras, ERK and BDNF in the hippocampus and 
      cerebral cortex regions of rat brains. CONCLUSION: Composited Aβ induced memory 
      impairment, decreased neurogenesis and initiated the abnormal mRNA and protein 
      expressions of Grb2, SOS1, Ras, ERK, and BDNF in the BDNF- ERK-CREB signaling 
      pathway. The effects of SSF in promoting neurogenesis and improving memory 
      impairment may be related to the regulation of the abnormal expressions of Grb2, 
      SOS1, Ras, ERK, and BDNF molecules in the BDNF-ERK-CREB signaling pathway.

AB  - PURPOSE: Despite being a major treatment modality for brain cancer due to its 
      efficiency in achieving cancer control, radiotherapy has long been known to cause 
      long-term side effects, including radiation-induced cognitive impairment (RICI). 
      Neurogenesis inhibition due to radiation-induced damage in neural stem cells 
      (NSCs) has been demonstrated to be an important mechanism underlying RICI. 
      Radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBEs) denote the biological responses in 
      non-targeted cells after their neighboring cells are irradiated. We have 
      previously demonstrated that RIBEs could play an important role in the skin wound 
      healing process. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether RIBEs contribute to 
      RICI in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The transwell co-culture method was 
      used to investigate bystander effects in mouse NSCs induced by irradiated GL261 
      mouse glioma cells in vitro. The proliferation, neurosphere-forming capacity and 
      differentiation potential of NSCs were determined as the bystander endpoints. The 
      exosomes were extracted from the media used to culture GL261 cells and were 
      injected into the hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice. Two months later, the neurogenesis 
      of mice was assessed using BrdU incorporation and immunofluorescence microscopy, 
      and cognitive function was evaluated by the Morris Water Maze. RESULTS: After 
      co-culture with GL261 glioma cells, mouse NSCs displayed inhibited proliferation 
      and reduced neurosphere-forming capacity and differentiation potential. The 
      irradiated GL261 cells caused greater inhibition and reduction in NSCs than 
      unirradiated GL261 cells. Moreover, adding the exosomes secreted by GL261 cells 
      into the culture of NSCs inhibited NSC proliferation, suggesting that the cancer 
      cell-derived exosomes may be critical intercellular signals. Furthermore, 
      injection of the exosomes from GL261 cells into the hippocampus of mice caused 
      significant neurogenesis inhibition and cognitive impairment two month later, and 
      the exosomes from irradiated GL261 cells induced greater inhibitory effects. 
      CONCLUSION: RIBEs mediated by the exosomes from irradiated cancer cells could 
      contribute to RICI and, therefore, could be a novel mechanism underlying RICI.

      the Activation of Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway in Mouse Model of Alzheimer's 
      Disease.
PG  - 424-436
LID - 10.1007/s12017-022-08708-z [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and age-related neurodegenerative disorder 
      that is manifested by neuropathological changes and clinical symptoms. Recently, 
      cell-based therapeutic interventions have been considered as the promising and 
      effective strategies in this field. Herein, we investigated therapeutic effects 
      of neural stem cell secretome on Alzheimer's disease-like model by triggering of 
      Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In this study, mice were randomly allocated into 
      three different groups as follows: Control, AD + Vehicle, and AD + NSCs-CM 
      groups. To induce mouse model of AD, Aβ1-42 was injected into 
      intracerebroventricular region. Following AD-like confirmation through thioflavin 
      S staining and Passive avoidance test, about 5 µl mouse NSCs-CM was injected into 
      the target areas 21 days after AD induction. For evaluation of endogenous 
      proliferation rate (BrdU/Nestin(+) cells), 50 µg/kbW BrdU was intraperitoneally 
      injected for 5 consecutive days. To track NSC differentiation, percent of 
      BrdU/NeuN(+) cells were monitored via immunofluorescence staining. Histological 
      Nissl staining was done to neurotoxicity and cell death in AD mice after NSCs-CM 
      injection. Morris Water maze test was performed to assess learning and memory 
      performance. Data showed that NSCs-CM could reverse the learning and memory 
      deficits associated with Aβ pathology. The reduced expression of 
      Wnt/β-catenin-related genes such as PI3K, Akt, MAPK, and ERK in AD mice was 
      increased. Along with these changes, NSCs-CM suppressed overactivity of GSK3β 
      activity induced by Aβ deposition. Besides, NSCs increased BrdU/Nestin(+) and 
      BrdU/NeuN(+) cells in a paracrine manner, indicating proliferation and neural 
      differentiation of NSCs. Moreover, neurotoxicity rate and cell loss were deceased 
      after NSCs-CM injection. In summary, NSCs can regulate adult neurogenesis through 
      modulating of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and enhance the behavioral 
      performance in the AD mice. These data present the alternative and effective 
      approach in the management of AD and other cognitive impairments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trimethyltin (TMT) is a potent neurotoxicant that leads to 
      hippocampal neurodegeneration. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role 
      in maintaining the immune balance in the central nervous system (CNS), but their 
      activities are impaired in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we aimed to 
      determine whether adoptive transfer of Tregs, as a living drug, ameliorates 
      hippocampal neurodegeneration in TMT-intoxicated mice. METHODS: CD4(+)CD25(+) 
      Tregs were expanded in vitro and adoptively transferred to TMT-treated mice. 
      First, we explored the effects of Tregs on behavioral deficits using the Morris 
      water maze and elevated plus maze tests. Biomarkers related to memory formation, 
      such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), protein kinase C (PKC), 
      neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN), nerve growth factor (NGF), and ionized calcium 
      binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) in the hippocampus were examined by 
      immunohistochemistry after killing the mouse. To investigate the 
      neuroinflammatory responses, the polarization status of microglia was examined in 
      vivo and in vitro using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
      (rtPCR) and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Additionally, the 
      inhibitory effects of Tregs on TMT-induced microglial activation were examined 
      using time-lapse live imaging in vitro with an activation-specific fluorescence 
      probe, CDr20. RESULTS: Adoptive transfer of Tregs improved spatial learning and 
      memory functions and reduced anxiety in TMT-intoxicated mice. Additionally, 
      adoptive transfer of Tregs reduced neuronal loss and recovered the expression of 
      neurogenesis enhancing molecules in the hippocampi of TMT-intoxicated mice. In 
      particular, Tregs inhibited microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine 
      release in the hippocampi of TMT-intoxicated mice. The inhibitory effects of TMT 
      were also confirmed via in vitro live time-lapse imaging in a Treg/microglia 
      co-culture system. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that adoptive transfer of 
      Tregs ameliorates disease progression in TMT-induced neurodegeneration by 
      promoting neurogenesis and modulating microglial activation and polarization.

TI  - Deltamethrin Exposure Inhibits Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Causes Deficits 
      in Learning and Memory in Mice.
PG  - 347-357
LID - 10.1093/toxsci/kfaa144 [doi]
AB  - Deficits in learning and memory are often associated with disruption of 
      hippocampal neurogenesis, which is regulated by numerous processes, including 
      precursor cell proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation to mature 
      neurons. Recent studies demonstrate that adult born neurons in the dentate gyrus 
      (DG) in the hippocampus can functionally integrate into the existing neuronal 
      circuitry and contribute to hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Here, we 
      demonstrate that relatively short-term deltamethrin exposure (3 mg/kg every 
      3 days for 1 month) inhibits adult hippocampal neurogenesis and causes deficits 
      in learning and memory in mice. Hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions were 
      evaluated using 2 independent hippocampal-dependent behavioral tests, the novel 
      object recognition task and Morris water maze. We found that deltamethrin-treated 
      mice exhibited profound deficits in novel object recognition and learning and 
      memory in water maze. Deltamethrin exposure significantly decreased 
      bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells (39%) and Ki67+ cells (47%) in the DG of 
      the hippocampus, indicating decreased cellular proliferation. In addition, 
      deltamethrin-treated mice exhibited a 44% decrease in nestin-expressing neural 
      progenitor cells and a 38% reduction in the expression of doublecortin (DCX), an 
      early neuronal differentiation marker. Furthermore, deltamethrin-exposed mice 
      exhibited a 25% reduction in total number of granule cells in the DG. These 
      findings indicate that relatively short-term exposure to deltamethrin causes 
      significant deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis that is associated with impaired 
      learning and memory.

PG  - 97

LID - 97
AB  - The formation and retention of hippocampus-dependent memories is impacted by 
      neurogenesis, a process that involves the production of new neurons in the 
      dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Recent studies demonstrate that increasing 
      neurogenesis after memory formation induces forgetting of previously acquired 
      memories. Neurogenesis-induced forgetting was originally demonstrated in mice, 
      but a recent report suggests that the same effect may be absent in rats. Although 
      a general species difference is possible, other potential explanations for these 
      incongruent findings are that memories which are more strongly reinforced become 
      resilient to forgetting or that perhaps only certain types of memories are 
      affected. Here, we investigated whether neurogenesis-induced forgetting occurs in 
      rats using several hippocampus-dependent tasks including contextual fear 
      conditioning (CFC), the Morris Water Task (MWT), and touchscreen paired 
      associates learning (PAL). Neurogenesis was increased following training using 
      voluntary exercise for 4 weeks before recall of the previous memory was assessed. 
      We show that voluntary running causes forgetting of context fear memories in a 
      neurogenesis-dependent manner, and that neurogenesis-induced forgetting is 
      present in rats across behavioral tasks despite differences in complexity or 
      reliance on spatial, context, or object memories. In addition, we asked whether 
      stronger memories are less susceptible to forgetting by varying the strength of 
      training. Even with a very strong training protocol in the CFC task, we still 
      observed enhanced forgetting related to increased neurogenesis. These results 
      suggest that forgetting due to neurogenesis is a conserved mechanism that aids in 
      the clearance of memories.

TI  - Grape seed extract effects on hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and dark 
      neurons production in old mice. Can this extract improve learning and memory in 
      aged animals?
PG  - 1962-1972
LID - 10.1080/1028415X.2021.1918983 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the elderly, hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptogenesis 
      reduce and dark neurons (DNs) increase, leading to cognitive impairment. It is 
      believed that natural products can protect the neural cells and system by 
      protecting from damages or promoting regeneration. Therefore, the effects of 
      grape seed extract (GSE) on the hippocampus of aged mice were investigated in 
      this study. METHODS: twelve old mice were divided into two groups of control and 
      GSE. Animals in the GSE group received 300 mg/kg of GSE for eight weeks via 
      gavage. At the end of treatment, cognition performance was evaluated by Morris 
      water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance tests. Hippocampal neurogenesis, 
      synaptogenesis and DNs production were evaluated with immunohistochemistry and 
      histological evaluations on 5-micron coronal tissue sections. RESULTS: The 
      hippocampal mean number of double cortin positive cells (DCX(+)) per unit area, 
      as well as synaptophysin expression in the GSE group, were significantly higher 
      than the control group (p < 0.01). The frequency of DNs in the GSE group was 
      lower than the control group (p < 0.05). Behavioral tests showed that GSE 
      improves memory and learning performance. CONCLUSION: Consuming GSE in the 
      elderly can potentially alleviate the age-related reduction of hippocampal 
      neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. It is also able to decrease hippocampal DNs 
      production and increase memory and learning.

AB  - Anesthetic sevoflurane induces mitochondrial dysfunction, impairment of 
      neurogenesis, and cognitive impairment in young mice, but the underlying 
      mechanism remains to be determined. Cyclophilin D (CypD) is a modulatory factor 
      for the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). We, therefore, set out 
      to evaluate the role of CypD in these sevoflurane-induced changes in vitro and in 
      young mice. Wild-type (WT) and CypD knockout (KO) young (postnatal day 6, 7, and 
      8) mice received 3% sevoflurane 2 h daily and the neural progenitor cells (NPCs) 
      harvested from the WT or CypD KO mice received 4.1% sevoflurane. We used 
      immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry imaging, flow cytometry, Western 
      blot, RT-PCR, co-immunoprecipitation, and Morris Water Maze to assess the 
      interaction of sevoflurane and CypD on mitochondria function, neurogenesis, and 
      cognition in vitro and in WT or CypD KO mice. We demonstrated that the 
      sevoflurane anesthesia induced accumulation of CypD, mitochondrial dysfunction, 
      impairment of neurogenesis, and cognitive impairment in WT mice or NPCs harvested 
      from WT mice, but not in CypD KO mice or NPCs harvested from CypD KO mice. 
      Furthermore, the sevoflurane anesthesia reduced the binding of CypD with Adenine 
      nucleotide translocator, the other component of mPTP. These data suggest that the

AB  - Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) is the first known G protein-coupled 
      receptor specific for bile acids and is recognized as a new and critical target 
      for type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. It is expressed in many brain regions 
      associated with memory such as the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Here, we 
      hypothesize that activation of TGR5 may ameliorate streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced 
      cognitive impairment. The mouse model of cognitive impairment was established by 
      a single intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of STZ (3.0 mg/kg), and we found 
      that TGR5 activation by its agonist INT-777 (1.5 or 3.0 μg/mouse, ICV injection) 
      ameliorated spatial memory impairment in the Morris water maze and Y-maze tests. 
      Importantly, INT-777 reversed STZ-induced downregulation of TGR5 and glucose 
      usage deficits. Our results further showed that INT-777 suppressed neuronal 
      apoptosis and improved neurogenesis which were involved in tau phosphorylation 
      and CREB-BDNF signaling. Moreover, INT-777 increased action potential firing of 
      excitatory pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA3 and medial prefrontal cortex 
      of ICV-STZ groups. Taken together, these findings reveal that activation of TGR5 
      has a neuroprotective effect against STZ-induced cognitive impairment by 
      modulating apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal firing in the brain and TGR5 
      might be a novel and potential target for Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - The Molecular Mechanism of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi Stems and Leaves 
      Flavonoids in Promoting Neurogenesis and Improving Memory Impairment by the 
      PI3K-AKT-CREB Signaling Pathway in Rats.
PG  - 919-933

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and molecular mechanism 
      of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi stems and leaves flavonoids (SSF) in promoting 
      neurogenesis and improving memory impairment induced by the PI3K-AKT-CREB 
      signaling pathway. METHODS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) was induced in the male 
      Wistar rats by intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid beta peptide 25-35 
      (Aβ(25-35)) in combination with aluminum trichloride (AlCl3) and recombinant 
      human transforming growth factor-β1(RHTGF-β1) (composited Aβ). The Morris water 
      maze was used to screen the successful establishment of the memory impairment 
      model of rats. The screened successful model rats were randomly divided into a 
      model group and three groups of three different doses of the drug (SSF). Rats in 
      the drug group were treated with 35, 70, and 140 mg/kg of SSF for 43 days. The 
      Eight-arm maze was used to measure the spatial learning and memory abilities of 
      the rat, including working memory errors (WME) and reference memory errors (RME). 
      Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of BrdU, an indicator of 
      neuronal proliferation, in the hippocampal gyrus of rats. The mRNA and protein 
      expressions of TRKB, PI3K, AKT, P-AKT, and IGF2 in the PI3K-AKT-CREB signaling 
      pathway in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of the rats were determined by 
      quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting methods. RESULTS: Compared 
      to the sham group, the spatial memory ability of rats with composited Aβ was 
      decreased, the number of WME and RME (P < 0.01) was increased, the expression of 
      BrdU protein (P < 0.01) in the hippocampal gyrus was reduced, the mRNA and 
      protein expression levels of TRKB, AKT, and IGF2 (P < 0.01, P < 0.05) in the 
      hippocampus and cerebral cortex were lowered, and the mRNA expression level of 
      PI3K (P < 0.01) in the cerebral cortex and the protein expression level of PI3K 
      (P < 0.01) in the hippocampus were augmented. However, compared to the model 
      group, the three-doses of SSF improved memory disorder induced by composited Aβ, 
      reduced the number of WME and RME, increased the expression of BrdU protein in 
      the hippocampal gyrus, and differently regulated the mRNA and protein expressions 
      in composited Aβ rats. CONCLUSION: SSF improved memory impairment and 
      neurogenesis disorder induced by composited Aβ in rats by activating the 
      PI3K-AKT-CREB signaling pathway and up-regulating the mRNA and protein 
      expressions of TRKB, PI3K, AKT, CREB, and IGF2.

      hypothyroidism.
PG  - 662-672
LID - 10.1080/00207454.2020.1835898 [doi]
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated protective effect of sodium selenite (Se) on 
      hypothyroidism-induced impairments in, Morris water maze (MWM), long-term 
      potentiation (LTP) and hippocampal neurogenesis male Wistar rats aged of 2 
      months. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hypothyroidism was induced by administration of 
      propylthiouracil (Ptu, 1 mg/kg/d) solution to the rats from postnatal day 60 for 
      81 days with or without Se (0.5mg/kg/d). Neurogenesis was examined by Ki-67 
      immunohistochemical staining. Se values on plasma and hippocampus were measured 
      with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). RESULTS: Measurement 
      of fT3 and fT4 levels confirmed that the fT3 levels, but not fT4, in Ptu-treated 
      rats (5435.44±816.05 fg/ml, p < 0.05) has returned to control values 
      (8721.66±2567.68 fg/ml) by Se treatment (8661.65±711.43 fg/ml). Analysis of 
      learning performance in water escape learning task showed that Se supplementation 
      disappeared memory deficit in Ptu-treated rats as shown by significantly 
      decreased time spent in the target quadrant (33.7±0.24% in control group; 
      26.1±0.48% in Ptu-group, p < 0.05; 33.9±0.44 in Ptu+Se group), although there was 
      no significant difference among groups in any measurement of learning performance 
      on the last day. Considering LTP, Se supplementation improved the deficit in 
      synaptic plasticity in Ptu-treated rats, as shown by significant increase in the 
      excitatory postsynaptic potential slope (% 243±31 in control group; 172±49 in 
      Ptu-group, p < 0.05; 222±65 in Ptu+Se group) without affecting of the impairment 
      in somatic plasticity. Se supplementation did not improve the decrease in the 
      number of progenitor cells in the subgranular layer (SGL) of dentate gyrus (DG) 
      of Ptu treated rats. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that selenium 
      supplementation in hypothyroid patients may improve learning and memory disorders 
      with different physiological mechanisms.HighlightsSe increased serum fT3 levels 
      and hippocampus Se levels in hypothyroid rats.Se attenuated impairment of 
      population spike-LTP in hypothyroid ratsHypothyroidism disrupts neurogenesis 
      process in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus.Se supplementation could not increase 
      new born cells in hypothyroid rats.

TI  - Melatonin mitigates hippocampal and cognitive impairments caused by prenatal 
      irradiation.
PG  - 3575-3594
LID - 10.1111/ejn.14687 [doi]
AB  - Formation of new neurons and glial cells in the brain is taking place in mammals 
      not only during prenatal embryogenesis but also during adult life. As an enhancer 
      of oxidative stress, ionizing radiation represents a potent inhibitor of 
      neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the brain. It is known that the pineal hormone 
      melatonin is a potent free radical scavenger and counteracts inflammation and 
      apoptosis in brain injuries. The aim of our study was to establish the effects of 
      melatonin on cells in the hippocampus and selected forms of behaviour in 
      prenatally irradiated rats. The male progeny of irradiated (1 Gy of gamma rays; 
      n = 38) and sham-irradiated mothers (n = 19), aged 3 weeks or 2 months, were used 
      in the experiment. Melatonin was administered daily in drinking water (4 mg/kg b. 
      w.) to a subset of animals from each age group. Prenatal irradiation markedly 
      suppressed proliferative activity in the dentate gyrus in both age groups. 
      Melatonin significantly increased the number of proliferative BrdU-positive cells 
      in hilus of young irradiated animals, and the number of mature NeuN-positive 
      neurons in hilus and granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus in these rats and 
      in CA1 region of adult irradiated rats. Moreover, melatonin significantly 
      improved the spatial memory impaired by irradiation, assessed in Morris water 
      maze. A significant correlation between the number of proliferative cells and 
      cognitive performances was found, too. Our study indicates that melatonin may 
      decrease the loss of hippocampal neurons in the CA1 region and improve cognitive 
      abilities after irradiation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) 
      antagonist, is widely applicable to anesthesia, analgesia, and sedation. However, 
      the function and mechanisms of ketamine in the long-term learning and memory 
      function of neonatal mice are unclear. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to 
      investigate whether long-term learning and memory function will be affected by 
      multiple ketamine exposures in the early development period. METHODS: The mRNA 
      and protein levels were measured by RT-qPCR and western blot, respectively. The 
      Morris Water Maze test was performed to assess spatial learning and memory. 
      RESULTS: We identified that neonatal exposure to ketamine downsized the positive 
      neurons for microtubule-associated protein doublecortin (DCX) and Ki67 in 
      hippocampal dentate gyrus at the juvenile and late adolescence stages. 
      Double-labeling tests demonstrated that the counts of Iba1(+) cells and Ki67(+) 
      cells were pronouncedly diminished with exposure to ketamine. Further, qPCR 
      assays to screen the key factors predisposing the populations and maturation of 
      microglia exhibited remarkable decline of CX3CR1 mRNA levels in ketamine group 
      versus the control group. The close relation of microglia to synaptic plasticity 
      was depicted by the significantly downregulated synaptic plasticity-related 
      proteins NR2B and PSD-95 subsequent to multiple exposures to ketamine. Finally, 
      we found that both the protein and mRNA levels of BDNF were markedly decreased in 
      ketamine group versus the control group. CONCLUSION: We found that multiple 
      exposures to ketamine in neonatal mice lead to spatial learning and memory 
      dysfunction. The alterations of microglial development and function are the 
      possible mechanisms of long-term learning and memory impairment.

AB  - Pubertal immune challenge can permanently alter hippocampus-dependent memory 
      processes in a sex-specific manner. Although gonadal hormones can influence 
      various cognitive processes, their role in regulating the cognitive sequelae to 
      pubertal immune challenge has not been thoroughly assessed. We examined whether a 
      pubertal immune challenge could affect hippocampus-dependent memory functions in 
      adulthood and whether these effects are regulated by gonadal steroid hormones. We 
      hypothesized that exposure to an immune challenge during puberty would induce 
      sex-specific deficits in the behavioral and cellular correlates of 
      hippocampus-dependent memory during adulthood. At six weeks of age, during the 
      stress-vulnerable pubertal period, male and female CD-1 mice were injected with 
      either saline or the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Three weeks 
      later, mice underwent either gonadectomy or sham-surgery. At ten weeks of age 
      (i.e., in adulthood), mice began behavioral testing in an open field, Barnes 
      maze, and Morris water maze. Brain tissue was collected at 17 weeks of age and 
      stained for doublecortin and Ki67 to examine migrating neuronal progenitor cells 
      and cellular proliferation in the neurogenic subgranular zone (SGZ) and the 
      cornus ammonis (CA)1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Pubertal LPS treatment 
      impaired learning during adulthood in both sexes and increased cellular 
      proliferation in the CA1 region in castrated males only. Although adult sex 
      hormones did not reliably modulate these changes, gonadectomy impaired learning 
      during the Morris water maze in both sexes. Learning deficits were more prominent 
      during the Barnes maze, which suggests a stress-dependent expression of 
      LPS-induced cognitive deficits. Neurogenesis in the SGZ and cellular 
      proliferation in the CA3 were not affected by pubertal LPS treatment or 
      gonadectomy. These novel findings emphasize the sensitivity of developing 
      cognitive processes during puberty to immune challenges and suggest a possible 
      mechanism for learning-based difficulties in adulthood.

TI  - Remote Ischemic Postconditioning vs. Physical Exercise After Stroke: an 
      Alternative Rehabilitation Strategy?
PG  - 3141-3157
LID - 10.1007/s12035-021-02329-6 [doi]
AB  - There remain debates on neuroprotection and rehabilitation techniques for acute 
      ischemic stroke patients. Therapeutic physical exercise following stroke has 
      shown promise but is challenging to apply clinically. Ischemic conditioning, 
      which has several clinical advantages, is a potential neuroprotective method for 
      stroke rehabilitation that is less understood. In the present study, the 
      rehabilitative properties and mechanisms of physical exercise and remote ischemic 
      postconditioning (RIPostC) after stroke were compared and determined. A total of 
      248 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups: (1) sham, (2) 
      stroke, (3) stroke with intense treadmill exercise, (4) stroke with mild 
      treadmill exercise, and (5) stroke with RIPostC. Focal ischemia was evaluated by 
      infarct volume and neurological deficit. Long-term functional outcomes were 
      represented through neurobehavioral function tests: adhesive removal, beam 
      balance, forelimb placing, grid walk, rota-rod, and Morris water maze. To further 
      understand the mechanisms underlying neurorehabilitation and verify the presence 
      thereof, we measured mRNA and protein levels of neuroplasticity factors, synaptic 
      proteins, angiogenesis factors, and regulation molecules, including HIF-1α, BDNF, 
      TrkB, and CREB. The key role of HIF-1α was elucidated by using the inhibitor, 
      YC-1. Both exercise intensities and RIPostC significantly decreased infarct 
      volumes and neurological deficits and outperformed the stroke group in the 
      neurobehavioral function tests. All treatment groups showed significant increases 
      in mRNA and protein expression levels of the target molecules for neurogenesis, 
      synaptogenesis, and angiogenesis, with intermittent further increases in the 
      RIPostC group. HIF-1α inhibition nullified most beneficial effects and indicative 
      molecule expressions, including HIF-1α, BDNF, TrkB, and CREB, in both procedures. 
      RIPostC is equally, or superiorly, effective in inducing neuroprotection and 
      rehabilitation compared to exercise in ischemic rats. HIF-1α likely plays an 
      important role in the efficacy of neuroplasticity conditioning, possibly through 
      HIF-1α/BDNF/TrkB/CREB regulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) is one of the most common 
      long-term complications for patients with malignant brain tumors after 
      radiotherapy. At present, there is no effective treatment for RIBI. Recent 
      studies have also confirmed that polysaccharides from laminaria japonica (LJP) 
      display potential neuroprotective function. However, its mechanisms of 
      neuroprotection remain unclear. AIM: In this study, we aimed to explore the 
      effect and underlying mechanism of LJP on neurogenesis in radiation-induced brain 
      injury mice. METHODS: SPF two-month-old male mice were randomly divided into 
      control group (Con), LJP treatment group (LJP), irradiation group (IR), and 
      irradiation with LJP treatment group (IR + LJP). LJP (40 mg/kg/day) was 
      intraperitoneally injected at one day before radiation for seven consecutive days 
      (once daily). The mice were exposed to 10 Gy × 2 fractionated doses, once every 
      other day, with a total dose of 20 Gy. Changes in cognitive function of mice 
      following radiation were evaluated by the Morris water maze test. Furthermore, 
      body weight and general status of mice were measured throughout the experiment. 
      Immunohistochemical staining for neural proliferating cells (Ki67+ cells) and 
      immature neurons (DCX + cells) was utilized to assay changes of neurogenesis in 
      hippocampus. Microglial activation and collagen IV deposition within the 
      neurogenic microenvironment were observed respectively by immunohistochemical 
      staining for Iba-1 and Collagen IV in the hippocampus. Levels of pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) in the hippocampus were detected by ELISA kits 
      post-radiation. RESULTS: Morris water maze test showed that LJP therapy markedly 
      reduced the escape latency and increased the times of crossing platform and 
      percent time of the target quadrant in the radiated mice. In addition, the 
      decrease of the neural proliferating cells (Ki67+ cells) and immature neurons 
      (DCX + cells) in the hippocampus of mice following irradiation was significantly 
      mitigated by the LJP treatment, suggesting that LJP could prevent from 
      neurogenesis damage after irradiation. LJP injection significantly attenuated 
      degradation of collagen IV, activation of microglia, and increase of 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) levels in the neurogenic 
      microenvironment of the hippocampus after radiation. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      suggest that LJP early treatment may mitigate radiation-induced cognitive 
      impairments and that its mechanism may relate to its protection of neurogenesis 
      by alleviating neuroinflammation and collagen IV degradation within the 
      neurogenic microenvironment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of peripheral transplantation of 
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) at sepsis convalescence on post-sepsis cognitive 
      function and underlying mechanisms in mice. METHODS: Sepsis was induced by cecal 
      ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice. Bone marrow-derived MSCs from mice were 
      cultured and injected via tail vein on the 8(th) day after CLP. Cognitive 
      function was detected in open field, novel object recognition task, and delayed 
      matching-to-place water maze task during 10-26 days after CLP. Neuroinflammation, 
      neurogenesis, and peripheral inflammation were detected on the 12(th) and 31(th) 
      days after CLP. MSCs tracing was detected during 8-10 days after CLP. RESULTS: 
      Transplanted MSCs were located at peripheral organs (lung, spleen, liver) and had 
      no obvious effects on survival and weight of sepsis mice. Transplanted MSCs 
      mitigated cognitive impairments and hippocampal microglial activation, improved 
      hippocampal neurogenesis of sepsis surviving mice, and had no obvious effect on 
      the leukocyte amount, the neutrophil percentage, and the inflammatory factors of 
      peripheral blood, and the hippocampal inflammatory factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our data 
      indicated that MSCs transplantation via peripheral vein at later phase of sepsis 
      can improve post-sepsis cognitive impairment and hippocampal neurogenesis of 
      sepsis surviving mice.

AB  - Studies have shown that sevoflurane, a halogenated inhalational anesthetic, 
      interferes with neurogenesis in the developing rodent brain. However, the 
      mechanisms by which sevoflurane affects neural stem cells (NSCs) differentiation 
      require further elucidation. Pregnant rats (gestational day 14) were anesthetized 
      with 3.5% sevoflurane for 2 h, with or without ML385 pretreatment. ML385 is a 
      specific nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) inhibitor. NRF2 
      expression and the downstream Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)/glioma-associated oncogene 
      homolog 1 (GLI1) signaling cascade were determined by western blotting in the 
      fetal brain at 24 h and 72 h after maternal sevoflurane exposure. 
      Immunofluorescence and western blotting were performed to evaluate NSC neuronal 
      and astrocytic differentiation in fetal brain tissues at 24 h and 72 h 
      post-anesthesia as well as in the hippocampus on postnatal day (P) 28. Nissl 
      staining was performed to measure the neuronal density on P28. Morris Water Maze 
      tests were used to evaluate learning and memory function on P28-33. Neuronal and 
      astrocytic differentiation of NSCs was markedly promoted in the fetal brain at 
      24 h and 72 h after maternal sevoflurane exposure, accompanied by upregulated 
      NRF2. However, neuronal reduction and astrocyte proliferation were observed in 
      the rat hippocampus at P28. Pretreatment with ML385 reversed sevoﬂurane-induced 
      premature differentiation of NSCs, accompanied by suppression of SHH/GLI1 
      signaling. Furthermore, ML385 rescued sevoflurane-induced decreased neuronal 
      density and impaired learning and memory function in the offspring. Prenatal 
      sevoflurane exposure promotes neuronal and astrocytic differentiation of NSCs in 
      the fetal rat brain, leading to long-term neuron reduction but astrocyte 
      proliferation in the postnatal rat hippocampus. Prenatal sevoflurane exposure 
      modulates NSC differentiation through NRF2/SHH/GLI1.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic excessive ethanol consumption damages the central nervous 
      system and causes neurobehavioral changes, such as cognitive impairment, which is 
      related to oxidative stress and inhibition of neurogenesis in the hippocampus. It 
      is known that promoting neurogenesis improves learning memory, anxiety and 
      depression. Lycium barbarum L. polyphenol (LBP) is the main active ingredient of 
      Lycium barbarum L., which has excellent neuroprotective effects. However, the 
      effects and mechanisms of LBP on ethanol-induced cognitive impairment are 
      unclear. PURPOSE: To assess the effects and mechanisms of LBP on ethanol-induced 
      cognitive impairment in mice. METHODS: Eight-weeks-old adult C57BL/6J mice were 
      allowed to drink ethanol (10%) to establish a model of ethanol-induced cognitive 
      impairment. From the 29th day of LBP (25, 50, 100, 200, 400 mg/kg, intragastric 
      administration), the locomotor activity, novel object recognition (NOR), Y maze 
      and Morris water maze (MWM) were sequentially performed to investigate the effect 
      of LBP on ethanol-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Next, enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence, and western blotting were used to study 
      the underlying mechanism of LBP on ethanol-induced cognitive impairment. RESULTS: 
      LBP significantly decreased the escape latency and increased the number of 
      crossings of the original platform in MWM, increased the spontaneous alteration 
      behavior in the Y maze, and increased the preference index in the NOR in 
      ethanol-induced mice. Notably, LBP significantly promoted the proliferation of 
      neural stem cells, neural progenitor cells and neuroblasts, and increased the 
      proportion of activated NSCs in mice with ethanol-induced cognitive impairment. 
      Similarly, LBP significantly increased the number of newborn immature neurons and 
      mature neurons. Moreover, LBP increased the levels of nuclear factor 
      erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and the downstream heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) 
      protein expression, which led to a decrease of oxidative stress levels. 
      CONCLUSION: LBP significantly improves cognitive impairment in ethanol-induced 
      mice, which is attributed to the promotion of hippocampal neurogenesis and 
      reduction of oxidative stress.

AB  - Ongoing neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) subregion of the hippocampus 
      results in a heterogenous population of neurons. Immature adult-born neurons 
      (ABNs) have physiological and anatomical properties that may give them a unique 
      role in learning. For example, compared to older granule neurons, they have 
      greater somatic excitability, which could facilitate their recruitment into 
      memory traces. However, recruitment is also likely to depend on interactions with 
      other DG neurons through processes such as lateral inhibition. Immature ABNs 
      target inhibitory interneurons and, compared to older neurons, they receive less 
      GABAergic inhibition. Thus, they may induce lateral inhibition of mature DG 
      neurons while being less susceptible to inhibition themselves. To test this we 
      used a chemogenetic approach to silence immature ABNs as rats learned a spatial 
      water maze task, and measured activity (Fos expression) in ABNs and 
      developmentally-born neurons (DBNs). A retrovirus expressing the inhibitory 
      DREADD receptor, hM4Di, was injected into the dorsal DG of male rats at 6w to 
      infect neurons born in adulthood. Animals were also injected with BrdU to label 
      DBNs or ABNs. DBNs were significantly more active than immature 4-week-old ABNs. 
      Silencing 4-week-old ABNs did not alter learning but it increased activity in 
      DBNs. However, silencing ABNs did not affect activation in other ABNs within the 
      DG. Silencing ABNs also did not alter Fos expression in parvalbumin- and 
      somatostatin-expressing interneurons. Collectively, these results suggest that 
      ABNs may directly inhibit DBN activity during hippocampal-dependent learning, 
      which may be relevant for maintaining sparse hippocampal representations of 
      experienced events.

      Depression.

LID - 972
AB  - Many studies evaluated the functional role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis 
      (AHN) and its key role in cognitive functions and mood regulation. The effects of 
      promoting AHN on the recovery of stress-induced symptoms have been well studied, 
      but its involvement in stress resilience remains elusive. We used a mouse model 
      enabling us to foster AHN before the exposure to unpredictable chronic mild 
      stress (UCMS) to evaluate the potential protective effects of AHN on stress, 
      assessing the depressive-like phenotype and executive functions. For this 
      purpose, an inducible transgenic mouse model was used to delete the pro-apoptotic 
      gene Bax from neural progenitors four weeks before UCMS, whereby increasing the 
      survival of adult-generated neurons. Our results showed that UCMS elicited a 
      depressive-like phenotype, highlighted by a deteriorated coat state, a higher 
      immobility duration in the tail suspension test (TST), and a delayed reversal 
      learning in a water maze procedure. Promoting AHN before UCMS was sufficient to 
      prevent the development of stressed-induced behavioral changes in the TST and the 
      water maze, reflecting an effect of AHN on stress resilience. Taken together, our 
      data suggest that increasing AHN promotes stress resilience on some 
      depressive-like symptoms but also in cognitive symptoms, which are often observed 
      in MD.

AB  - Neurogenesis is a complex process involved in memory formation and is known to be 
      altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuroinflammation and insulin signaling 
      dysfunction, key players during intracerebroventricular Streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) 
      induced dementia variedly affects neurogenesis. The aim of this work was to study 
      the variation in neurogenic process associated with AD in ICV STZ induced 
      dementia. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 180-200 g were given two 
      different doses of ICV STZ (3 mg/kg on Day 1 and 3, & 1 mg/kg on Day 1) in two 
      different experimental setup. Memory functions were assessed by Morris Water 
      Maze. Immunofluorescence and western blotting was done to study the variation in 
      neurogenesis, amyloid and tau pathology, neuroinflammation and insulin signaling. 
      ICV STZ 6 mg/kg (3 mg/kg twice on Day 1 and 3 of 21 days study) caused impairment 
      in learning and memory and severe atrophy of the neurogenic areas. Modified dose 
      of ICV STZ (1 mg/kg once on Day 1) caused a significant decline in neurogenesis 
      in subventricular zone (SVZ) and dentate gyrus (DG) as indicated by decrease in 
      the number of (5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) BrdU(+) Nestin(+) cells, Doublecortin 
      (DCX(+)) cells and BrdU(+) NeuN(+) cells after day 11 and 18 of ICV STZ 
      injection. However, impairment in learning and memory was observed only during 18 
      days study post ICV STZ injection (1 mg/kg on Day 1). Up regulation of proteins 
      of amyloid and tau pathology (Amyloid precursor protein (APP), β site amyloid 
      precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) & p-Tau Ser 396) was observed at this 
      time point with no significant change in amyloid β(42) (Aβ(42)) expression. 
      Enhanced neuroinflammation (increased Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) & 
      nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB)) and 
      diminished insulin signaling was also observed in our study in both neurogenic 
      areas, however the extent to which they may have negative impact on neurogenes is 
      yet to be explored.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several lines of evidence suggest that neuroinflammation might be a 
      key neurobiological mechanism of depression. In particular, the P2X7 receptor 
      (P2X7R), an ATP-gated ion channel involved in activation of the pro-inflammatory 
      interleukin IL-1β, has been shown to be a potential new pharmacological target in 
      depression. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of unpredictable 
      chronic mild stress (UCMS) on behavioural changes, hippocampal neurogenesis, and 
      cellular characterisation of brain immune cells, in P2X7R Knock-Out (KO) mice. 
      METHODS: P2X7R KO and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to a 6-week UCMS 
      protocol and received a conventional oral antidepressant (15 mg.kg(-1) 
      fluoxetine) or water per os. The mice then underwent behavioural tests consisting 
      of the tail suspension test (TST), the elevated plus maze (EPM) test, the open 
      field test, the splash test and the nest building test (week 7). Doublecortin 
      immunostaining (DCX) of brain slices was used to assess neurogenesis in the 
      dentate gyrus. Iba1 and TMEM119 immunostaining was used to characterise brain 
      immune cells, Iba1 as a macrophage marker (including microglial cells) and 
      TMEM119 as a potential specific resident microglial cells marker. RESULTS: After 
      a 6-week UCMS exposure, P2X7R KO mice exhibited less deterioration of their coat 
      state, spent a significantly smaller amount of time immobile in the TST and spent 
      a larger amount of time in the open arms of the EPM. As expected, adult ventral 
      hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly decreased by UCMS in WT mice, while 
      P2X7R KO mice maintained ventral hippocampal neurogenesis at similar levels in 
      both control and UCMS conditions. In stress-related brain regions, P2X7R KO mice 
      also exhibited less recruitment of Iba1+/TMEM119+ and Iba1+/TMEM119- cells in the 
      brain. The ratio between these two staining patterns revealed that brain immune 
      cells were mostly composed of Iba1+/TMEM119+ cells (87 to 99%), and this ratio 
      was affected neither by P2X7R genetic depletion nor by antidepressant treatment. 
      DISCUSSION: Behavioural patterns, neurogenesis levels and density of brain immune 
      cells in P2X7R KO mice after exposure to UCMS significantly differed from control 
      conditions. Brain immune cells were mostly increased in brain regions known to be 
      sensitive to UCMS exposure in WT but not in P2X7R KO mice. Considering 
      Iba1+/TMEM119- staining might characterize peripheral immune cells, the ratio 
      between Iba1+/TMEM119+ cells and IBA1+/TMEM119- cells, suggests that the rate of 
      peripheral immune cells recruitment may not be modified neither by P2X7R gene 
      expression nor by antidepressant treatment.

AB  - Neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus plays a major role in cognitive ability of 
      animals including learning and memory. Korean red ginseng (KRG) has long been 
      known as a medicinal herb with the potential to improve learning and memory; 
      however, the mechanisms are still elusive. Therefore, we evaluated whether KRG 
      can promote cognitive function and enhance neurogenesis in the hippocampus. 
      Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice received 50 mg/kg of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine 
      (BrdU) intraperitoneally and 100 mg/kg of KRG or vehicle orally once a day for 14 
      days. Pole, Rotarod and Morris water maze tests were performed and the brains 
      were collected after the last behavioral test. Changes in the numbers of BrdU- 
      and BrdU/doublecortin (DCX; a marker for neuronal precursor cells and immature 
      neurons)-positive cells in the dentate gyrus and the gene expression of 
      proliferating cell nuclear antigen (a marker for cell differentiation), cerebral 
      dopamine neurotrophic factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus 
      were then investigated. KRG-treated mice came down the pole significantly faster 
      and stood on the rotarod longer than vehicle-treated mice. The Morris water maze 
      test showed that KRG administration enhanced the learning and memory abilities 
      significantly. KRG also significantly increased BrdU- and BrdU/DCX-positive cells 
      in the dentate gyrus as well as the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cerebral 
      dopamine neurotrophic factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor mRNA expression 
      levels in the hippocampus compared to vehicle. Administration of KRG promotes 
      learning and memory abilities, possibly by enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis. 
      This study was approved by the Pusan National University Institutional Animal 
      Care and Use Committee (approval No. PNU-2016-1071) on January 19, 2016.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Interventions for preventing cognitive dysfunction after traumatic 
      brain injury (TBI) are limited. Given that adult hippocampal neurogenesis after 
      brain injury contributes to cognitive recovery, and hippocampal neurogenesis is 
      potentially affected by nutritional factors, the aim of this study was to examine 
      whether fasting could promote hippocampal neurogenesis and thus ameliorate the 
      cognitive defects after TBI. METHODS: The present study used 8- to 10-wk-old C57 
      BL/6 N mice weighing 23 g, half males and half females. The mice were randomly 
      assigned to each group, with 10 to 18 mice per group. All mice were housed in an 
      approved animal facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle. In the metabolic study 
      (food intake, body weight, blood glucose, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, and 
      β-hydroxybutyric acid ), 54 mice (male:female = 1:1) were randomized to the ad 
      libitum (AL) group (n = 18) and the intermittent fasting (IF) group (n = 36). In 
      the neurogenesis study, 45 mice (male:female = 1:1) were randomized to AL 
      (n  = 18), IF (n  = 9), IF + scramble (n  = 9), and the IF + neuropeptide Y 
      (NPY)_siRNA (n  = 9) groups. In the Morris water maze test, 48 mice 
      (male:female = 1:1) were randomized to AL (n  = 12), IF (n  = 12), IF + scramble 
      (n  = 12), and the IF + NPY_siRNA (n  = 12) groups. RESULTS: We showed that a 
      1-mo-long IF regimen enhanced the proliferation of neural stem cells in the 
      subgranular zone of the hippocampus 3 d after TBI, in addition to improving the 
      cognitive performance in the Morris water maze test. Furthermore, an increase in 
      the hippocampal NPY expression was detected in the IF group after the injury, 
      compared with the mice fed AL, and local knockdown of NPY in vivo attenuated the 
      effects of IF on TBI. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that IF promotes 
      hippocampal neurogenesis after TBI by a mechanism that involves enhancement of 
      NPY expression, to alleviate cognitive dysfunction caused by injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common NDs leading to 
      cognitive dysfunctions and dementia which are progressively worsen with age. Cell 
      therapy is currently of particular interest in treatment of neurodegenerative 
      disease (ND) such as AD. However, the effective treatment for AD is yet to be 
      found. OBJECTIVE: In this study, the possible roles of human umbilical mesnchymal 
      stromal cord (hUMSCs) and adipose mesenchymal stem cells (hAD-MSCs) in 
      neurogenesis and synaptic function were investigated using a β-amyloid 1-42 (β 
      A42)-induced AD rat model. METHODS: hUMSCs and hAD-MSCs were isolated from 
      umbilical cord stroma and adipose tissue, respectively. The expression of 
      Mesenchymal (CD73, CD90 and CD105) and hematopoietic (CD45 and CD133) markers of 
      hUMSCs and hAD-MSCs were confirmed by flow cytometry. Alzheimer's rat model was 
      created by β-amyloid 1-42 injection into the hippocampus and confirmed by Morris 
      Water Maze and immunohistochemical staining. hUMSCs and hAD-MSCs were injected in 
      Alzheimer's rat model, intravenously. Deposition of β-amyloid in the CA1 of 
      hippocampus was assayed 3 months after cell administration. The expression of 
      synaptophysin and GAP43 proteins was assessed by Western blot. Neural death was 
      assessed by Nissl staining. RESULTS: The data obtained from flow cytometry showed 
      that surface mesenchymal and hematopoteic markers of the fibroblastic like cells 
      isolated from adipose tissue and umbilical cord were expressed highly in hUMSCs 
      and mostly in hAD-SCs. Transplantation of MSCs reduced β-amyloid deposition in 
      the hippocampus of the AD rats compared to the β-amyloid group. The rate of 
      neuronal cell death in the hippocampus of the β-amyloid-treated rats was 
      significantly increased compared to that of the control group. The percentage of 
      apoptotic cells in this group was 72.98 ± 1.25, which was significantly increased 
      compared to the control group. Transplantation of either hUMSCs or hAD-SCs, 
      respectively, resulted in a significant reduction in the apoptotic rate of the 
      neuronal cells in the hippocampus by 39.47 ± 0.01 (p = 0.0001) and 43.23 ± 0.577 
      (p = 0.001) compared to the β-amyloid group. MSC transplantation resulted in a 
      significant up-regulation in the expression levels of both synaptogenic 
      (synaptophysin) and neurogenic markers (GAP43) by 1.289 ± 0.112 (P = 0.02) and 
      1.112 ± 0.106 (P = 0.005) fold in the hUMSCs-treated group and 1.174 ± 0.105 (P = 
      0.04) and 0.978 ± 0.167 (P = 0.008) fold in the hAD-SCs-treated group, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Intravenous injection of hUMSCs and hAD-MSCs is a safe 
      approach that improves synaptic function and neurogenesis via up-regulation of 
      synaptophysin and GAP43 protein expression levels, respectively, in Alzheimer's 
      model. Intravenous injection of both applied SCs could improve learning and 
      cognitive impairment induced by β A42 injection.

AB  - Age-related cognitive impairments are associated with differentially expressed 
      genes (DEGs) linked to defined neural systems; however, studies examining 
      multiple regions of the hippocampus fail to find links between behavior and 
      transcription in the dentate gyrus (DG). We hypothesized that use of a task 
      requiring intact DG function would emphasize molecular signals in the DG 
      associated with a decline in performance. We used a water maze beacon 
      discrimination task to characterize young and middle-age male F344 rats, followed 
      by a spatial reference memory probe trial test. Middle-age rats showed increased 
      variability in discriminating two identical beacons. Use of an allocentric 
      strategy and formation of a spatial reference memory were not different between 
      age groups; however, older animals compensated for impaired beacon discrimination 
      through greater reliance on spatial reference memory. mRNA sequencing of 
      hippocampal subregions indicated DEGs in the DG of middle-age rats, linked to 
      synaptic function and neurogenesis, correlated with beacon discrimination 
      performance, suggesting that senescence of the DG underlies the impairment. Few 
      genes correlated with spatial memory across age groups, with a greater number in 
      region CA1. Age-related CA1 DEGs, correlated with spatial memory, were linked to 
      regulation of neural activity. These results indicate that the beacon task is 
      sensitive to impairment in middle age, and distinct gene profiles are observed in 
      neural circuits that underlie beacon discrimination performance and allocentric 
      memory. The use of different strategies in older animals and associated 
      transcriptional profiles could provide an animal model for examining cognitive 
      reserve and neural compensation of aging.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Hippocampal 
      subregions are thought to differentially contribute to memory. We took advantage 
      of age-related variability in performance on a water maze beacon task and 
      next-generation sequencing to test the hypothesis that aging of the dentate gyrus 
      is linked to impaired beacon discrimination and compensatory use of allocentric 
      memory. The dentate gyrus expressed synaptic function and neurogenesis genes 
      correlated with beacon discrimination in middle-age animals. Spatial reference 
      memory was associated with CA1 transcriptional correlates linked to regulation of 
      neural activity and use of an allocentric strategy. This is the first study 
      examining transcriptomes of multiple hippocampal subregions to link age-related 
      impairments associated with discrimination of feature overlap and alternate 
      response strategies to gene expression in specific hippocampal subregions.

TI  - Ethyl pyruvate protects against sepsis-associated encephalopathy through 
      inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome.

LID - 55
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the advance of antibiotics and life support therapy, the 
      mortality of sepsis has been decreasing in recent years. However, the incidence 
      of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), a common complication of sepsis, is 
      still high. There are few effective therapies to treat clinical SAE. We 
      previously found that ethyl pyruvate (EP), a metabolite derivative, is able to 
      effectively inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Administration of ethyl 
      pyruvate protects mice against polymicrobial sepsis in cecal ligation and 
      puncture (CLP) model. The aim of present study is to investigate if ethyl 
      pyruvate is able to attenuate SAE. METHODS: After CLP, C57BL/6 mice were 
      intraperitoneally or intrathecally injected with saline or ethyl pyruvate using 
      the sham-operated mice as control. New Object Recognition (NOR) and Morris Water 
      Maze (MWM) were conducted to determine the cognitive function. Brain pathology 
      was assessed via immunohistochemistry. To investigate the mechanisms by which 
      ethyl pyruvate prevent SAE, the activation of NLRP3 in the hippocampus and the 
      microglia were determined using western blotting, and cognitive function, 
      microglia activation, and neurogenesis were assessed using WT, Nlrp3(-/-) and 
      Asc(-/-) mice in the sublethal CLP model. In addition, Nlrp3(-/-) and Asc(-/-) 
      mice treated with saline or ethyl pyruvate were subjected to CLP. RESULTS: Ethyl 
      pyruvate treatment significantly attenuated CLP-induced cognitive decline, 
      microglia activation, and impaired neurogenesis. In addition, EP significantly 
      decreased the NLRP3 level in the hippocampus of the CLP mice, and inhibited the 
      cleavage of IL-1β induced by NLRP3 inflammsome in microglia. NLRP3 and ASC 
      deficiency demonstrated similar protective effects against SAE. Nlrp3(-/-) and 
      Asc(-/-) mice significantly improved cognitive function and brain pathology when 
      compared with WT mice in the CLP models. Moreover, ethyl pyruvate did not have 
      additional effects against SAE in Nlrp3(-/-) and Asc(-/-) mice. CONCLUSION: The 
      results demonstrated that ethyl pyruvate confers protection against SAE through 
      inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome.

AB  - With its capacity to modulate motor control and motivational as well as cognitive 
      functions dopamine is implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric diseases. The 
      present study investigated whether an imbalance in dopamine homeostasis as 
      evident in the dopamine overexpressing rat model (DAT-tg), results in learning 
      and memory deficits associated with changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. 
      Adult DAT-tg and control rats were subjected to the Morris water maze, the radial 
      arm maze and a discrimination reversal paradigm and newly generated neurons in 
      hippocampal circuitry were investigated post mortem. DAT-tg rats were found to 
      exhibit a striking inability to acquire information and deploy spatial search 
      strategies. At the same time, reduced integration of adult-born neurons in 
      hippocampal circuitry was observed, which together with changes in striatal 
      dopamine signalling might explain behavioural deficits.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the potential role of C-X-C chemokine receptor 
      type (CXCR) 5 in neurocognitive function in a mouse model of sepsis-associated 
      encephalopathy (SAE). Adult male C57BL/6J mice received intracerebroventricular 
      injections of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against CXCR5 or scrambled control 
      siRNA. After 3 days, SAE was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP, n = 16 
      per group). Memory and learning ability were tested using the Morris water maze 
      (MWM) on days 5-9 after CLP. Hippocampal expression of CXCR5, interleukin (IL)-1β 
      and IL-6 were measured by western blot. Cell proliferation and the numbers of 
      immature and mature neurons in the dentate gyrus were assessed by 
      immunohistochemistry. CLP mice had deficits in memory and learning, as shown by 
      increased latency in the MWM training sessions and decreased time spent in and 
      crossing the target quadrant on day 9. CLP also increased the number of 
      proliferating and immature neurons and decreased the number of mature neurons. 
      This was accompanied by increased expression of CXCR5, IL-1β and IL-6 in the 
      hippocampus. CXCR5 knockdown attenuated the memory and learning deficits induced 
      by CLP and partially reversed the effects of CLP on numbers of proliferating, 
      immature and mature neurons, and on expression of IL-1β and IL-6 in the 
      hippocampus. These results suggest that CXCR5 knockdown can attenuate 
      sepsis-induced deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function in 
      mice with SAE.

TI  - Effects of Combined Anti-Hypertensive and Statin Treatment on Memory, Fear

AB  - Hyperlipidemia and hypertension are modifiable risk factors for cognitive 
      decline. About 25% of adults over age 65 use both antihypertensives (AHTs) and 
      statins to treat these conditions. Recent research in humans suggests that their 
      combined use may delay or prevent dementia onset. However, it is not clear 
      whether and how combination treatment may benefit brain function. To begin to 
      address this question, we examined effects of atorvastatin, a 
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, and 
      Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), administration on 
      memory function, anxiety-like behavior, adult hippocampal neurogenesis and 
      angiogenesis in adult and middle-aged male C57Bl/6J mice. In adult mice 
      (3-months-old) combination (combo) treatment, as well as administration of each 
      compound individually, for six weeks, accelerated memory extinction in contextual 
      fear conditioning. However, pattern separation in the touchscreen-based location 
      discrimination test, a behavior linked to adult hippocampal neurogenesis, was 
      unchanged. In addition, dentate gyrus (DG) neurogenesis and vascularization were 
      unaffected. In middle-aged mice (10-months-old) combo treatment had no effect on 
      spatial memory in the Morris water maze, but did reduce anxiety in the open field 
      test. A potential underlying mechanism may be the modest increase in new 
      hippocampal neurons (~20%) in the combo as compared to the control group. DG 
      vascularization was not altered. Overall, our findings suggest that statin and 
      anti-hypertensive treatment may serve as a potential pharmacotherapeutic approach 
      for anxiety, in particular for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients who 
      have impairments in extinction of aversive memories.

TI  - proNGF Involvement in the Adult Neurogenesis Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 10.3390/ijms221910744 [doi]
LID - 10744
AB  - In recent decades, neurogenesis in the adult brain has been well demonstrated in 
      a number of animal species, including humans. Interestingly, work with rodents 
      has shown that adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is 
      vital for some cognitive aspects, as increasing neurogenesis improves memory, 
      while its disruption triggers the opposite effect. Adult neurogenesis declines 
      with age and has been suggested to play a role in impaired progressive learning 
      and memory loss seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, therapeutic 
      strategies designed to boost adult hippocampal neurogenesis may be beneficial for 
      the treatment of AD. The precursor forms of neurotrophins, such as pro-NGF, 
      display remarkable increase during AD in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. 
      In contrast to mature NGF, pro-NGF exerts adverse functions in survival, 
      proliferation, and differentiation. Hence, we hypothesized that pro-NGF and its 
      p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) contribute to disrupting adult hippocampal 
      neurogenesis during AD. To test this hypothesis, in this study, we took advantage 
      of the availability of mouse models of AD (APP/PS1), which display memory 
      impairment, and AD human samples to address the role of pro-NGF/p75NTR signaling 
      in different aspects of adult neurogenesis. First, we observed that DG 
      doublecortin (DCX) + progenitors express p75NTR both, in healthy humans and 
      control animals, although the percentage of DCX+ cells are significantly reduced 
      in AD. Interestingly, the expression of p75NTR in these progenitors is 
      significantly decreased in AD conditions compared to controls. In order to assess 
      the contribution of the pro-NGF/p75NTR pathway to the memory deficits of APP/PS1 
      mice, we injected pro-NGF neutralizing antibodies (anti-proNGF) into the DG of 
      control and APP/PS1 mice and animals are subjected to a Morris water maze test. 
      Intriguingly, we observed that anti-pro-NGF significantly restored memory 
      performance of APP/PS1 animals and significantly increase the percentage of DCX+ 
      progenitors in the DG region of these animals. In summary, our results suggest 
      that pro-NGF is involved in disrupting spatial memory in AD, at least in part by 
      blocking adult neurogenesis. Moreover, we propose that adult neurogenesis 
      alteration should be taken into consideration for better understanding of AD 
      pathology. Additionally, we provide a new molecular entry point (pro-NGF/p75NTR 
      signaling) as a promising therapeutic target in AD.

TI  - 20-Hydroxyecdysone Improves Neuronal Differentiation of Adult Hippocampal Neural 
      Stem Cells in High Power Microwave Radiation-Exposed Rats.
PG  - 504-517

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The hippocampus is thought to be a vulnerable target of microwave 
      exposure. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether 
      20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) acted as a fate regulator of adult rat hippocampal 
      neural stem cells (NSCs). Furthermore, we investigated if 20E attenuated high 
      power microwave (HMP) radiation-induced learning and memory deficits. METHODS: 
      Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: normal 
      controls, radiation treated, and radiation+20E treated. Rats in the radiation and 
      radiation+20E treatment groups were exposed to HPM radiation from a microwave 
      emission system. The learning and memory abilities of the rats were assessed 
      using the Morris water maze test. Primary adult rat hippocampal NSCs were 
      isolated in vitro and cultured to evaluate their proliferation and 
      differentiation. In addition, hematoxylin & eosin staining, western blotting, and 
      immunofluorescence were used to detect changes in the rat brain and the 
      proliferation and differentiation of the adult rat hippocampal NSCs after HPM 
      radiation exposure. RESULTS: The results showed that 20E induced neuronal 
      differentiation of adult hippocampal NSCs from HPM radiation-exposed rats via the 
      Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling pathway in vitro. Furthermore, 20E facilitated 
      neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the rat brain following HPM radiation 
      exposure. Administration of 20E attenuated learning and memory deficits in HPM 
      radiation-exposed rats and frizzled-related protein (FRZB) reduced the 
      20E-induced nuclear translocation of β-catenin, while FRZB treatment also 
      reversed 20E-induced neuronal differentiation of NSCs in vitro. CONCLUSION: These 
      results suggested that 20E was a fate regulator of adult rat hippocampal NSCs, 
      where it played a role in attenuating HPM radiation-induced learning and memory 
      deficits.

TI  - Intracerebral Transplantation of Neural Stem Cells Restores Manganese-Induced 
      Cognitive Deficits in Mice.
PG  - 371-385
LID - 10.14336/AD.2020.0717 [doi]
AB  - Manganese (Mn) is a potent neurotoxin known to cause long-lasting structural 
      damage and progressive cognitive deficits in the brain. However, new therapeutic 
      approaches are urgently needed since current treatments only target symptoms of 
      Mn exposure. Recent studies have suggested a potential role for multipotent 
      neural stem cells (NSCs) in the etiology of Mn-induced cognitive deficits. In 
      this study, we evaluated the effect of direct intracerebral transplantation of 
      NSCs on cognitive function of mice chronically exposed to MnCl(2), and further 
      explored the distribution of transplanted NSCs in brain tissues. NSCs were 
      isolated and bilaterally injected into the hippocampal regions or lateral 
      ventricles of Mn-exposed mice. The results showed that many transplanted cells 
      migrated far away from the injection sites and survived in vivo in the Mn-exposed 
      mouse brain, implying enhanced neurogenesis in the host brain. We found that NSCs 
      transplanted into either the hippocampal regions or the lateral ventricles 
      significantly improved spatial learning and memory function of the Mn-exposed 
      mice in the Morris water maze. Immunofluorescence analyses indicated that some 
      surviving NSCs differentiated into neurons or glial cells, which may have become 
      functionally integrated into the impaired local circuits, providing a possible 
      cellular basis for the improvement of cognitive function in NSC-transplanted 
      mice. Taken together, our findings confirm the Mn-induced impairment of 
      neurogenesis in the brain and underscore the potential of treating Mn exposure by 
      NSC transplantation, providing a practical therapeutic strategy against this type 
      of neurotoxicity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis is considered an important 
      cause of cognitive impairment, while changes in mossy fiber sprouting are closely 
      related to development of spontaneous recurrent seizures in chronic temporal lobe 
      epilepsy (TLE). Racemic l-3-n-butylphthalide (DL-NBP) can alleviate cognitive 
      impairment in ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease by promoting neurogenesis. 
      DL-NBP treatment can also improve cognitive function and reduce seizure incidence 
      in chronic epileptic mice. However, the mechanisms of action of DL-NBP remain 
      unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of DL-NBP on 
      mossy fiber sprouting, hippocampal neurogenesis, spontaneous epileptic seizures, 
      and cognitive functioning in the chronic phase of TLE. METHODS: Nissl staining 
      was used to evaluate hippocampal injury, while immunofluorescent staining was 
      used to analyze hippocampal neurogenesis. The duration of spontaneous seizures 
      was measured by electroencephalography. The Morris water maze was used to 
      evaluate cognitive function. Timm staining was used to assess mossy fiber 
      sprouting. RESULTS: TLE animals showed reduced proliferation of newborn neurons, 
      cognitive dysfunction, and spontaneous seizures. Treatment with DL-NBP after TLE 
      increased the proliferation and survival of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus, 
      reversed the neural loss in the hippocampus, alleviated cognitive impairments, 
      and decreased mossy fiber sprouting and long-term spontaneous seizure activity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We provided pathophysiological and morphological evidence that 
      DL-NBP might be a useful therapeutic for the treatment of TLE.

AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) participate in the response to infection, stress, and 
      injury by initiating an innate immune response. In addition, these receptors are 
      expressed in many neural cell types and under physiological conditions are 
      implicated in modulating cognitive function and neural plasticity in the adult 
      and aged brain. Knockout of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) subtype enhances 
      spatial memory and adult hippocampal neurogenesis through increasing 
      proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Currently unknown is whether 
      pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 produces similar enhancements in cognitive 
      function and cell proliferation. The present study evaluated water maze 
      performance, cytokine expression, and cell proliferation in the hippocampus of 
      young and aged male and female C57BL6/J mice following treatment with the TLR4 
      antagonist, TAK-242. Further, alterations in the response to an acute stressor 
      were evaluated in TAK-242-treated mice. Results showed that TAK-242 selectively 
      enhanced spatial learning and memory in young females. Additionally, TAK-242 
      treatment reduced thigmotaxis in the water maze and lowered corticosterone levels 
      following acute stress in females. TAK-242 decreased hippocampal interleukin 
      (IL)-1β expression but had no effect on IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). 
      Aged mice showed decreased cell proliferation compared to young mice, but TAK-242 
      administration had minimal effects on estimated Ki67 positive cell numbers. 
      Findings indicate that pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 improves cognitive 
      function in young females likely through attenuating stress reactivity.

AB  - Cognitive impairment is one of the most common and disabling co-morbidities of 
      epilepsy. It is therefore imperative to find novel treatment approaches to rescue 
      cognitive function among epilepsy patients. Adult neurogenesis is strongly 
      implicated in cognitive function, and mild hypoxia is known to promote the 
      proliferation and differentiation of both embryonic and adult neural stem cells 
      (NSCs). In the present study, we investigated the effect of mild hypoxia on 
      cognitive function and hippocampal neurogenesis of rats with pilocarpine-induced 
      chronic epilepsy. Chronic epilepsy induced marked spatial learning and memory 
      deficits in the Morris water maze that were rescued by consecutively 28 days mild 
      hypoxia exposure (6 h/d at 3000 m altitude equivalent) during the chronic phase. 
      Moreover, mild hypoxia reversed the suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis and 
      the downregulation of NT-3 and BDNF expression in hippocampus and cortex of 
      epileptic rats. Mild hypoxia in vitro also promoted hippocampus-derived NSC 
      proliferation and neuronal differentiation. In addition, mild hypoxia enhanced 
      Notch1 and Hes1 expression, suggesting that Notch1 signaling may be involved in 
      neuroprotection of hypoxia. Our data may help to pave the way for identifying new 
      therapeutic targets for rescuing cognition conflicts in epileptic patients by 
      using hypoxia to promote hippocampus neurogenesis.

AB  - Early life, covering childhood and adolescence in humans, is an important period 
      of brain development and maturation. Experimental works in rodents have shown 
      that high-caloric diets are particularly detrimental to young rats, affecting 
      cognition. We studied the effects of two different high-caloric diets, prevalent 
      in human adolescents, on male Wistar rats aged 4 weeks at the beginning of the 
      experiment. Rats were randomly allocated to control (C, n = 10), high-sugar diet 
      (HS, n = 10) and cafeteria diet (CAF, n = 10) groups and fed accordingly for 
      8 weeks. At the end of this period, behavioral tests were performed to analyze 
      (1) anxiety behavior in the elevated plus-maze and open field tests, (2) learning 
      and memory processes in the Morris water maze and novel object recognition test, 
      (3) fear response in the fear conditioning test, and (4) depression state in the 
      forced swim test. We also examined neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus using the 
      marker of neuroproliferation doublecortin (DCX). Our results show that CAF rats 
      have impaired spatial learning and memory and increased anxiety, without changes 
      in the remaining aspects of behavior, associated with a reduction of the total 
      number of DCX-immunoreactive cells in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus. 
      Conversely, HS rats displayed no changes in behavior and neurogenesis. These data 
      demonstrate that diets rich in saturated fats and sugar are more detrimental for 
      juvenile rats than diets with high sugar content in what concerns their effects 
      in anxiety-related behaviors, spatial learning and memory, and neurogenesis. 
      These findings may help explain the cognitive disturbances observed in obese 
      human adolescents, who consume high-caloric diets.

AB  - We and others have reported that Notch3 is a regulator of adult hippocampal 
      neurogenesis. Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts 
      and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), the most common genetic form of vascular 
      dementia, is caused by mutations in Notch3. The present study intended to 
      investigate whether there is a correlation between altered adult hippocampal 
      neurogenesis and spatial memory performance in CADASIL transgenic mice. To 
      overcome visual disabilities that hampered behavioral testing of the original 
      mice (on an FVB background) we back-crossed the existing TgN3 (R169C) CADASIL 
      mouse model onto the C57BL/6J background. These animals showed an age-dependent 
      increase in the pathognomonic granular osmiophilic material (GOM) deposition in 
      the hippocampus. Analysis in the Morris water maze task at an age of 6 and 12 
      months revealed deficits in re-learning and perseverance in the CADASIL 
      transgenic mice. Overexpression of Notch3 alone resulted in deficits in the use 
      of spatial strategies and diminished adult neurogenesis in both age groups. The 
      additional CADASIL mutation compensated the effect on strategy usage but not on 
      adult neurogenesis. In brain bank tissue samples from deceased CADASIL patients 
      we found signs of new neurons, as assessed by calretinin immunohistochemistry, 
      but no conclusive quantification was possible. In summary, while our study 
      confirmed the role of Notch3 in adult neurogenesis, we found a specific effect of 
      the CADASIL mutation only on the reversion of the Notch3 effect on behavior, 
      particularly visible at 6 months of age, consistent with a loss of function. The 
      mutation did not revert the Notch3-dependent changes in adult neurogenesis or 
      otherwise affected adult neurogenesis in this model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is a serious complication of diabetes that 
      manifests as an impairment of spatial memory and learning ability. Its 
      pathogenesis is unclear, and effective therapeutic drugs are very limited. Our 
      group designed and synthesized a novel compound named 3-p-tolyl-9H-xanthen-9-one 
      (Tozan). In this study, we sought to investigate the effects and mechanism of 
      Tozan on diabetic cognitive impairment. METHODS: Methylglyoxal (MG)-induced 
      SH-SY5Y cells and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic mice were treated 
      with Tozan. Methyl thiazolul tetrazolium (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
      were used to test cytotoxicity. Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests were 
      used to evaluate cognitive function. Immunofluorescence and western blot analyses 
      were used to evaluate neurogenesis, apoptosis, and signal transduction 
      pathway-related proteins. In addition, Lentivirus (LV)-estrogen receptor beta 
      (ERβ)-ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) was used to knockdown the ERβ gene in 
      SH-SY5Y cells. RESULTS: We found that Tozan ameliorated MG-induced cytotoxicity 
      in SH-SY5Y cells, improved cognitive dysfunction in STZ-induced type 1 diabetic 
      mice, increased neurogenesis, and prevented apoptotic responses in vitro and in 
      vivo. Importantly, Tozan (2, 4, and 8 mg/kg) mediated 
      phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and protein kinase B cAMP-response element binding 
      protein (PI3K/Akt-CREB) signaling by activating membrane ERβ, and a high dose of 
      Tozan (8 mg/kg) mediated CREB signaling by activating nuclear ERβ in the 
      hippocampus. Notably, Tozan did not have an anti-apoptosis and regeneration 
      protective role in ERβ gene knockdown cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates 
      Tozan's contributions to and role in cognition, neurogenesis, and apoptosis in 
      diabetes, and lays an experimental foundation for the development of new 
      anti-diabetic cognitive impairment drugs.

AB  - Acoustic information transduced by cochlear hair cells is continuously relayed 
      from the auditory pathway to other sensory, motor, emotional and cognitive 
      centers in the central nervous system. Human epidemiological studies have 
      suggested that hearing loss is a risk factor for dementia and cognitive decline, 
      but the mechanisms contributing to these memory and cognitive impairments are 
      poorly understood. To explore these issues in a controlled experimental setting, 
      we exposed adult rats to a series of intense blast wave exposures that 
      significantly reduced the neural output of the cochlea. Several weeks later, we 
      used the Morris Water Maze test, a hippocampal-dependent memory task, to assess 
      the ability of Blast Wave and Control rats to learn a spatial navigation task 
      (memory acquisition) and to remember what they had learned (spatial memory 
      retention) several weeks earlier. The elevated plus maze and open field arena 
      were used to test for anxiety-like behaviors. Afterwards, hippocampal cell 
      proliferation and neurogenesis were evaluated using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), 
      doublecortin (DCX), and Neuronal Nuclei (NeuN) immunolabeling. The Blast Wave and 
      Control rats learned the spatial navigation task equally well and showed no 
      differences on tests of anxiety. However, the Blast Wave rats performed 
      significantly worse on the spatial memory retention task, i.e., remembering where 
      they had been two weeks earlier. Deficits on the spatial memory retention task 
      were associated with significant decreases in hippocampal cell proliferation and 
      neurogenesis. Our blast wave results are consistent with other experimental 
      manipulations that link spatial memory retention deficits (long term memory) with 
      decreased cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. These results 
      add to the growing body of knowledge linking blast-induced cochlear hearing loss 
      with the cognitive deficits often seen in combat personnel and provide 
      mechanistic insights into these extra auditory disorders that could lead to 
      therapeutic interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whilst concerns have been raised about the detrimental effects of 
      general anaesthetics on the brain's development and function in the young, 
      reports have indicated that thyroid hormones are able to promote neurogenesis in 
      the developing brain. This present study aimed to investigate the effects of 
      triiodothyronine (T3) on the neonatal rat brain, following sevoflurane exposure. 
      METHODS: Postnatal day 7 (P7) ratpups were treated with Triiodothyronine (T3) 
      (1 µg/100 g body weight, i.p. injection, once/day for 3 days) after 2% 
      sevoflurane exposure for 6 h. They were sacrificed at either P7 (immediately), 
      P15 or P30 and their brains were harvested to assess cell death, proliferation in 
      the hippocampus, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit A and B, and a 
      post-synaptic protein (PSD-95 in the hippocampus,). Neuro-behavioral changes in 
      other cohorts between P27 and P30 were evaluated with Morris water maze and open 
      field tests. RESULTS: Sevoflurane exposure caused cell death and suppressed the 
      proliferation of astrocytes and neurons, as well as the dendritic growth of 
      neurons in the hippocampus which were all reversed by the administration of T3. 
      Moreover, cognitive function, including learning, memory, and adaptability to a 
      new environment, were impaired by sevoflurane exposure, which was also negated by 
      T3 treatment. Furthermore, sevoflurane decreased the expression of NMDA receptor 
      subunits NR2A and NR2B, as well as PSD-95 in the hippocampus at P15 and those 
      effects of sevoflurane were abolished by T3 administration. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      potential therapeutic role of T3 in protecting general anesthetic induced 
      neuronal injury in the developing brain is likely to occur through enhancing 
      expression of PSD-95 and the NMDA NR2A and NR2B expression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both animal studies and prospective observational studies on patients 
      with neurodegenerative disease have reported a positive link between oral 
      diseases and cognitive function. However, the effect of early tooth loss on 
      hippocampal morphology remains unknown. METHODS: In this study, 6-week-old, male, 
      juvenile Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomized into the control (C) and tooth 
      loss (TL) groups. In the TL group, all right maxillary molars of SD rats were 
      extracted, while in the C group, no teeth were extracted. After 3 months, the 
      learning and memory behavior were examined by Morris Water Maze (MWM), and the 
      protein expression and mechanic signaling pathways were analyzed by real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction, and cresyl violet staining. RESULTS: Two days after 
      the operation, the body weight of both groups recovered and gradually returned to 
      the level before operation. Three months after tooth extraction, the completion 
      time of the C group in the MWM was significantly shorter than the TL group. The 
      mRNA expression of BDNF, TrkB, AKT1, and NR2B in the C group were significantly 
      higher than in the TL group. The pyramidal neurons in the TL group was fewer than 
      in the C group. CONCLUSION: Tooth loss in the juvenile SD rats will reduce the 
      number of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, inhibit the expression of BDNF, 
      TrkB, AKT1, and NR2B, and eventually lead to cognitive dysfunction.

TI  - GABA(B) receptor antagonist promotes hippocampal neurogenesis and facilitates 
      cognitive function recovery following acute cerebral ischemia in mice.

AB  - PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that promoting endogenous 
      neurogenesis has great significance for the recovery of cognitive dysfunction 
      caused by cerebral ischemia (CI). Pharmacological inhibition of GABA(B) receptor 
      can enhance neurogenesis in adult healthy and depressed mice. In the study, we 
      intended to investigate the effects of GABA(B) receptor antagonists on cognitive 
      function and hippocampal neurogenesis in mice following CI. METHODS: Adult mice 
      were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) for 20 min to 
      induce CI and treated with CGP52432 (antagonist of GABA(B) receptor, CGP, 
      10 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection) starting 24 h after CI. The Morris water maze 
      test was performed to test spatial learning and memory at day 28. 
      Immunofluorescence was applied to detect neurogenesis in the DG region at day 14 
      and 28. In in vitro experiments, cell proliferation was detected by CCK8 and 
      immunofluorescence, and the expression of cAMP/CREB signaling pathway-related 
      proteins was detected by ELISA assay and Western blot. RESULTS: CGP significantly 
      improved spatial learning and memory disorders caused by CI, and it enhanced the 
      proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs), the number of immature neurons, and 
      the differentiation from newborn cells to neurons. In vitro experiments further 
      confirmed that CGP dose-dependently enhanced the cell viability of NSCs, and 
      immunofluorescence staining showed that CGP promoted the proliferation of NSCs. 
      In addition, treatment with CGP increased the expression of cAMP, PKA, and pCREB 
      in cultured NSCs. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of GABA(B) receptor can effectively 
      promote hippocampal neurogenesis and improve spatial learning and memory in adult 
      mice following CI.

AB  - Eugenol, as the main component in clove, has neuroprotective abilities, including 
      its effect to learning memory of mice. However, there is no evidence showing 
      whether eugenol can expand the growth of dendrites in the brain. The objective of 
      this research was to examine the effects of eugenol towards dendritic complexity 
      of neurons, neurogenesis, and memory performance in hippocampus. A total of 21 
      mice were divided into three groups; (i) mice were administered 30 mg/kg bw 
      eugenol orally, (ii) mice were administered 100 mg/kg bw eugenol orally, and 
      (iii) mice were administered distilled water as control. Mice were kept for 30 
      consecutive days following the standard animal housing. The memory performance 
      was observed through the Y-arm maze alternation, Novel Object Recognition (NOR), 
      and Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. The brain was dissected and stained with FD 
      Rapid Golgi StainingTM kit to observe dendrites in the dentate gyrus (DG) and 
      cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region; and Haematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining to assess 
      neurogenesis in the DG. Our results showed that eugenol enhanced putative neural 
      stem cells (NPCs) and granular cells (GC) number, and also decrease neuronal cell 
      death in DG (p<0.0001). Eugenol also increased dendritic complexity of neurons in 
      DG region; while in CA1, eugenol has given a positive effect only on the basal 
      area. Eugenol increased spatial and recognition memory in mice, indicated by a 
      higher number of correct alternations and discrimination ratio compared to the 
      control group (p<0.05), although escape latency in MWM did not show significant 
      effect (p>0.05). As analyzed by behavioral tests and Golgi staining of brain 
      tissue, eugenol can increase memory performance, neurogenesis, and dendritic 
      complexity of neurons in the DG and CA1 basal region of brain in mice.

AB  - Folates, provided by food, are commonly used antidepressant synergists in 
      late-onset depression (LOD). However, increased intake of folic acid in the 
      elderly population might lead to the accumulation of unmetabolized folic acid in 
      the systemic circulation, leading to enhanced deterioration of the central 
      nervous system function. In addition, folates cannot access the brain directly 
      because of the blood-brain barrier. Choroid plexus (CP) 5-methyltetrahydrofolate 
      (5-MTHF) brain transport plays a critical role in regulating the cerebrospinal 
      fluid (CSF) 5-MTHF content. Luteolin is a natural flavonoid that has 
      antidepressant effects and is involved in the anti-folate resistance pathway. It 
      remains unclear whether the antidepressant effects of luteolin are associated 
      with the CP 5-MTHF brain transport. In this study, 20-21-month-old Wistar rats 
      were exposed to the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) protocol for 6 
      consecutive weeks to explore the long-term effects of luteolin on behavior, 
      5-MTHF levels, hippocampal neurogenesis, and folate brain transport of the CP. In 
      vitro primary hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) cultured in media containing 
      10% CSF from each group of rats and choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPECs) 
      cultured in media containing 20 μM luteolin were treated with 100 μM 
      corticosterone and 40 mg/ml D-galactose. We found that aged rats exposed to CUMS 
      showed a significantly reduced sucrose preference, decreased locomotion activity 
      in the open field test and accuracy of the Morris water maze test, increased 
      immobility time in the forced swimming test, accelerated dysfunctional 
      neurogenesis and neuronal loss in the dentate gyrus of LOD rats, as well as 
      decreased CSF and hippocampus 5-MTHF levels, and zona occludens protein 1 (ZO-1), 
      proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT), and reduced folate carrier (RFC) 
      protein levels. In vitro assays showed media containing 10% aged CSF or LOD+ 
      Luteolin-CSF significantly increased the viability of CORT + D-gal-injured NSCs 
      and alleviated dysfunctional neurogenesis and neuronal loss compared with the 
      CORT + D-gal medium. However, media containing 10% LOD-CSF had no such effect. In 
      the meantime, induction of CORT + D-gal significantly decreased the ZO-1, PCFT, 
      RFC, and folate receptor alpha (FR-α) protein levels and transepithelial 
      electrical resistance in rat CPECs. As expected, luteolin treatment was effective 
      in improving these abnormal changes. These findings suggested that luteolin could 
      ameliorate CUMS-induced LOD-like behaviors by enhancing the folate brain 
      transport.

TI  - Stimulatory effects of (-)-epicatechin and its enantiomer (+)-epicatechin on 
      mouse frontal cortex neurogenesis markers and short-term memory: proof of 
      concept.
PG  - 3504-3515

AB  - Consumption of (-)-epicatechin (Epi), a cacao flavanol improves cognition. The 
      aim was to compare the effects of (-)-Epi or its stereoisomer (+)-Epi on mouse 
      frontal cortex-dependent short-term working memory and modulators of 
      neurogenesis. Three-month-old male mice (n = 7 per group) were provided by gavage 
      either water (vehicle; Veh), (-)-Epi, at 1 mg kg-1 or (+)-Epi at 0.1 mg per kg of 
      body weight for 15 days. After treatment, spontaneous alternation was evaluated 
      by Y-maze. Brain frontal cortex was isolated for nitrate/nitrite measurements, 
      Western blotting for nerve growth factor (NGF), microtubule associated protein 2 
      (MAP2), endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (eNOS and nNOS) and 
      immunohistochemistry for neuronal specific protein (NeuN), doublecortin (DCX), 
      capillary (CD31) and neurofilaments (NF200). Results demonstrate the stimulatory 
      capacity of (-)-Epi and (+)-Epi on markers of neuronal proliferation as per 
      increases in immunoreactive cells for NeuN (74 and 120% respectively), DCX (70 
      and 124%) as well as in NGF (34.4, 63.6%) and MAP2 (41.8, 63.8%). Capillary 
      density yielded significant increases with (-)-Epi (∼80%) vs. (+)-Epi (∼160%). 
      CD31 protein levels increased with (-)-Epi (∼70%) and (+)-Epi (∼140%). Effects 
      correlated with nitrate/nitrite stimulation by (-)-Epi and (+)-Epi (110.2, 
      246.5%) and enhanced eNOS phosphorylation (Ser1177) with (-)-Epi and (+)-Epi 
      (21.4, 41.2%) while nNOS phosphorylation only increased with (+)-Epi (18%). 
      Neurofilament staining was increased in (-)-Epi by 135.6 and 84% with (+)-Epi. 
      NF200 increased with (-)-Epi (116%) vs. (+)-Epi (84.5%). Frontal cortex-dependent 
      short-term spatial working improved with (-)-Epi and (+)-Epi (15, 13%). In 
      conclusion, results suggest that both enantiomers, but more effectively (+)-Epi, 
      upregulate neurogenesis markers likely through stimulation of capillary formation 
      and NO triggering, improvements in memory.

TI  - Enteral enriched nutrition to prevent cognitive dysfunction after surgery; a 
      study in rats.
PG  - 100305

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays an important role in postoperative cognitive 
      dysfunction (POCD), particularly in elderly patients. Enteral enriched nutrition 
      was shown to inhibit the response on inflammatory stimuli. Aim of the present 
      study was to explore the therapeutic potential of enteral enriched nutrition in 
      our rat model for POCD. The anticipated mechanism of action was examined in young 
      rats, while responses in the target group of elderly patients were evaluated in 
      old rats. METHODS: Male 3 and 23 months old Wistar rats received a bolus of 
      enteral fat/protein-enriched nutrition 2 ​h and 30 ​min before surgery. The 
      inflammatory response was evaluated by systemic inflammation markers and brain 
      microglia activity. Additionally, in old rats, the role of the gut-brain axis was 
      studied by microbiome analyses of faecal samples. Days 9-14 after surgery, rats 
      were subjected to cognitive testing. Day 16, rats were sacrificed and brains were 
      collected for immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In young rats, enriched nutrition 
      improved long-term spatial learning and memory in the Morris Water Maze, reduced 
      plasma IL1-β and VEGF levels, but left microglia activity and neurogenesis 
      unaffected. In contrast, in old rats, enriched nutrition improved short-term 
      memory in the novel object- and novel location recognition tests, but impaired 
      development of long-term memory in the Morris Water Maze. Systemic inflammation 
      was not affected, but microglia activity seemed even increased. Gut integrity and 
      microbiome were not affected. CONCLUSION: Enteral enriched nutrition before 
      surgery in young rats indeed reduced systemic inflammation and improved cognitive 
      performance after surgery, whereas old rats showed a mixed favorable/unfavorable 
      cognitive response, without effect on systemic inflammation. Anti-inflammatory 
      effects of enriched nutrition were not reflected in decreased microglia activity. 
      Neither was an important role for the gut-brain axis observed. Since the 
      relatively straight forward effects of enriched nutrition in young rats could not 
      be shown in old rats, as indicated by a mixed beneficial/detrimental cognitive 
      outcome in the latter, caution is advised by translating effects seen in younger 
      patients to older ones.

TI  - Ligustilide enhances hippocampal neural stem cells activation to restore 
      cognitive function in the context of postoperative cognitive dysfunction.
PG  - 5000-5015
LID - 10.1111/ejn.15363 [doi]
AB  - Ligustilide exerts potential neuroprotective effects against various cerebral 
      ischaemic insults and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the function and 
      mechanisms of LIG-mediated hippocampal neural stem cells (H-NSCs) activation as 
      well as cognitive recovery in the context of post-operative cognitive dysfunction 
      (POCD) remain elusive and need to be explored. Mice were subjected to transient 
      global cerebral ischaemia and reperfusion (tGCI/R) injury and treated with LIG 
      (80 mg/kg) or vehicle for 1 month. Morris water maze test and western blot were 
      employed to assess cognitive function. Nissl staining and immunofluorescence (IF) 
      staining were used to detect H-NSCs proliferation and neurogenesis in 
      hippocampus. Subsequently, primary H-NSCs were treated with LIG, and the level of 
      H-NSCs proliferation and neuronal-differentiation was examined by IF staining for 
      Edu and β-Tubulin III. The protein levels of ERK1/2, β-catenin, NICD, TLR4, Akt 
      and FoxO1 were examined using western blotting. Finally, pretreatment with the 
      ERK agonist SCH772984 was performed to observe the change in ERK expression. LIG 
      treatment promoted H-NSCs proliferation and neurogenesis, increased the number of 
      neurons in the hippocampal subfields, and ultimately reversed cognitive 
      impairment in tGCI/R injury. Furthermore, LIG also promoted primary H-NSCs 
      proliferation and neuronal-differentiation, as well as ERK1/2 phosphorylation. 
      Pretreatment with SCH772984 effectively reversed the ability of LIG to induce 
      ERK1/2 phosphorylation and promote H-NSCs proliferation and 
      neuronal-differentiation. LIG can promote cognitive recovery after tGCI/R injury 
      by activating ERK1/2 in H-NSCs to promote their proliferation and neurogenesis in 
      the hippocampus. Therefore, LIG has potential for use in the prevention and/or 
      treatment of POCD.

TI  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram ameliorates cognitive decline 
      and protects against amyloid beta-induced mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, 
      autophagy, mitophagy and synaptic toxicities in a mouse model of Alzheimer's 
      disease.
PG  - 789-810

AB  - In the current study, we investigated the protective role of citalopram against 
      cognitive decline, impaired mitochondrial dynamics, defective mitochondrial 
      biogenesis, defective autophagy, mitophagy and synaptic dysfunction in APP 
      transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (ad). We treated 12-month-old 
      wild-type (WT) and age-matched transgenic APP mice with citalopram for 2 months. 
      Using Morris Water Maze and rotarod tests, quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblotting, 
      biochemical methods and transmission electron microscopy methods, we assessed 
      cognitive behavior, RNA and protein levels of mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, 
      autophagy, mitophagy, synaptic, ad-related and neurogenesis genes in wild-type 
      and APP mice treated and untreated with citalopram. Citalopram-treated APP mice 
      relative to citalopram-untreated APP mice exhibited improved cognitive behavior. 
      Increased levels of mRNA associated with mitochondrial fission and ad-related 
      genes; decreased levels of fusion, biogenesis, autophagy, mitophagy, synaptic and 
      neurogenesis genes were found in APP mice relative to WT mice. However, APP mice 
      treated with citalopram compared to citalopram-untreated APP mice revealed 
      reduced levels of the mitochondrial fission and ad-related genes and increased 
      fusion, biogenesis, autophagy, mitophagy, synaptic and neurogenesis genes. Our 
      protein data agree with the mRNA levels. Transmission electron microscopy 
      revealed significantly increased mitochondrial numbers and reduced mitochondrial 
      length in APP mice; these were reversed in citalopram-treated APP mice. Further, 
      Golgi-cox staining analysis revealed reduced dendritic spines in APP mice 
      relative to WT mice. However, citalopram-treated APP mice showed significantly 
      increased dendritic spines, indicating that citalopram enhances spine density, 
      synaptic activity and improved cognitive function in APP mice. These findings 
      suggest that citalopram reduces cognitive decline, Aβ levels and mitochondrial 
      and synaptic toxicities and may have a strong protective role against mutant APP

AB  - Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is commonly used plasticizer and a known endocrine 
      disruptor that can cause birth defects and developmental disorders. Although 
      several studies have reported that DBP has neurotoxic effects on neurite 
      outgrowth and on learning and memory, its neurotoxic effects on neural progenitor 
      cells (NPCs) have not been investigated. The present study was undertaken to 
      determine the effects of DBP on NPCs and hippocampal neurogenesis. At high 
      concentration DBP (500 μM) retarded NPC proliferation without affecting cell 
      viability by arresting the cell cycle at G1 but did not cause cell death. DNA 
      damage was observed by examining p53 expression and by γH2AX staining. 
      DBP-treated cells had elevated ROS levels and exhibited mitochondrial 
      dysfunction, which can cause DNA damage. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was 
      investigated using BrdU immunohistochemistry in young C57BL/6 mice 
      intraperitoneally administrated with vehicle or DBP (10 or 50 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. 
      DBP administered mice were found to have significantly fewer newly generated 
      neurons in hippocampi, and the Morris water maze test revealed that DBP 
      (50 mg/kg) impaired spatial learning and memory. Taken together, these findings 
      suggest that DBP has harmful effects on NPCs and hippocampal neurogenesis and 
      that DBP exposure could lead to learning and memory dysfunctions.

TI  - Diacylglycerol Lipase-Alpha Regulates Hippocampal-Dependent Learning and Memory 
      Processes in Mice.
PG  - 5949-5965
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1353-18.2019 [doi]
AB  - Diacylglycerol lipase-α (DAGL-α), the principal biosynthetic enzyme of the 
      endogenous cannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) on neurons, plays a key role 
      in CB(1) receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity and hippocampal neurogenesis, but 
      its contribution to global hippocampal-mediated processes remains unknown. Thus, 
      the present study examines the role that DAGL-α plays on LTP in hippocampus, as 
      well as in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory tasks, and on the 
      production of endocannabinoid and related lipids through the use of complementary 
      pharmacologic and genetic approaches to disrupt this enzyme in male mice. Here we 
      show that DAGL-α gene deletion or pharmacological inhibition disrupts LTP in CA1 
      of the hippocampus but elicits varying magnitudes of behavioral learning and 
      memory deficits in mice. In particular, DAGL-α(-/-) mice display profound 
      impairments in the Object Location assay and Morris Water Maze (MWM) acquisition 
      engaging in nonspatial search strategies. In contrast, WT mice administered the 
      DAGL-α inhibitor DO34 show delays in MWM acquisition and reversal learning, but 
      no deficits in expression, extinction, forgetting, or perseveration processes in 
      this task, as well as no impairment in Object Location. The deficits in synaptic 
      plasticity and MWM performance occur in concert with decreased 2-AG and its major 
      lipid metabolite (arachidonic acid), but increases of a 2-AG diacylglycerol 
      precursor in hippocampus, PFC, striatum, and cerebellum. These novel behavioral 
      and electrophysiological results implicate a direct and perhaps selective role of 
      DAGL-α in the integration of new spatial information.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Here 
      we show that genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of diacylglycerol 
      lipase-α (DAGL-α) impairs hippocampal CA1 LTP, differentially disrupts spatial 
      learning and memory performance in Morris water maze (MWM) and Object Location 
      tasks, and alters brain levels of endocannabinoids and related lipids. Whereas 
      DAGL-α(-/-) mice exhibit profound phenotypic spatial memory deficits, a DAGL 
      inhibitor selectively impairs the integration of new information in MWM 
      acquisition and reversal tasks, but not memory processes of expression, 
      extinction, forgetting, or perseveration, and does not affect performance in the 
      Objection Location task. The findings that constitutive or short-term DAGL-α 
      disruption impairs learning and memory at electrophysiological and selective in 
      vivo levels implicate this enzyme as playing a key role in the integration of new 
      spatial information.

AB  - Depression, cognitive deficits, and sleep disturbances are common and often 
      severe in menopausal women. Hormone replacement cannot effectively alleviate 
      these symptoms and sometimes elicits life-threatening adverse reactions. 
      Exploring effective therapies to target psychological problems is urgently 
      needed. In this work, we developed a mouse model of menopause by bilateral 
      ovariectomies (OVXs) and investigated whether menopausal mental symptoms can be 
      ameliorated by psychostimulant modafinil (MOD) as well as explored the underlying 
      mechanisms. At ~3 weeks after OVXs, mice got daily intraperitoneal 
      administrations of MOD at the beginning of the active phase. Several behavioral 
      tests and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were conducted. 
      Electrophysiological and immunohistochemical experiments were carried out to 
      evaluate the synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, respectively. We found that 
      chronic MOD administration in OVX mice significantly decreased immobility time. 
      The spatial memory performance of OVX mice improved significantly in response to 
      MOD administration in the Morris water-maze test. The OVX mice were characterized 
      by an attenuation of hippocampal synaptic transmission and synaptic long-term 
      potentiation and had fewer 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine-labeled cells in the dentate 
      gyrus, which were restored after MOD administration. Antagonists of dopamine D(1) 
      and D(2) receptors and GABA(A) receptor agonists were involved in MOD-exerted 
      anti-depressant actions and augments of hippocampal neurogenesis in OVX mice. 
      Moreover, night-dosed MOD therapy significantly promoted the night-time 
      delta-band EEG power during wakefulness and the day-time rapid eye movement sleep 
      amount, which were significantly reduced by OVXs. Collectively, these findings 
      suggest that MOD is a promising therapeutic candidate for menopausal women.

AB  - Physical exercise plays a role on the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD), but the exercise mode and the mechanism for these positive effects 
      is still ambiguous. Here, we investigated the effect of an aerobic interval 
      exercise, running in combination with swimming, on behavioral dysfunction and 
      associated adult neurogenesis in a mouse model of AD. We demonstrate that 4 weeks 
      of the exercise could ameliorate Aβ(42) oligomer-induced cognitive impairment in 
      mice utilizing Morris water maze tests. Additionally, the exercised Aβ(42) 
      oligomer-induced mice exhibited a significant reduction of anxiety- and 
      depression-like behaviors compared to the sedentary Aβ(42) oligomer-induced mice 
      utilizing an Elevated zero maze and a Tail suspension test. Moreover, by 
      utilizing 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as an exogenous cell tracer, we found that 
      the exercised Aβ(42) oligomer-induced mice displayed a significant increase in 
      newborn cells (BrdU(+) cells), which differentiated into a majority of neurons 
      (BrdU(+) DCX(+) cells or BrdU(+)NeuN(+) cells) and a few of astrocytes 
      (BrdU(+)GFAP(+) cells). Likewise, the exercised Aβ(42) oligomer-induced mice also 
      displayed the higher levels of NeuN, PSD95, synaptophysin, Bcl-2 and lower level 
      of GFAP protein. Furthermore, alteration of serum metabolites in transgenic AD 
      mice between the exercised and sedentary group were significantly associated with 
      lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and neurotransmitters. These findings 
      suggest that combined aerobic interval exercise-mediated metabolites and proteins 
      contributed to improving adult neurogenesis and behavioral performance after AD 
      pathology, which might provide a promising therapeutic strategy for AD.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays an important role in health and disease. 
      Regulating neurogenesis may be a key mechanism in the pathophysiology and 
      treatment of several neurobehavioral disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, 
      autism spectrum disorders and Alzheimer's disease. Cytokines are known to affect 
      adult neurogenesis, but conflicting studies have been reported with regard to 
      their actual role. Interleukine-17 (IL-17), a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, 
      has been shown to inhibit proliferation of neuroprogenitors and thus reduce 
      hippocampal neurogenesis, while other studies suggested it can promote neurite 
      outgrowth. In the present study we sought to explore the possible effect of a 
      single dose administration of IL-17 on neurogenesis related behavior, i.e. 
      spatial learning. Surprisingly, ICR mice injected with IL-17 (8 μg) had a 
      significant slight improvement in spatial learning in the Morris water maze 
      paradigm, without any changes in general locomotion compared with control mice. 
      Indeed, the expression of neurogenesis related genes was down regulated following 
      IL-17 treatment. However, we detected an upregulation in the expression of 
      FGF-13, a gene promoting microtubule polymerization and neurite outgrowth, thus 
      supporting neuronal maturation. We thus suggest that IL-17 has a complex role in 
      regulating adult neurogenesis: inhibiting neuroprogenitors proliferation on one 
      hand, while promoting maturation of already formed neuroblasts on the other hand. 
      Our findings suggest that these roles can potentially affect neurogenesis related 
      behavior. Its actual role in health and disease is yet to be determined.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with notable factors of 
      dysfunction in multiple neurological changes, encompassing neuronal loss in the 
      frontal cortex and hippocampal regions. Dysfunction of proliferation and 
      self-renewal of neural stem cells (NSCs) was observed in AD patients and animals. 
      Thereby, mobilizing endogenous neurogenesis by pharmacological agents would 
      provide a promising route for neurodegeneration. Osthole (Ost), a natural 
      coumarin derivative, has been reported to exert extensive neuroprotective effects 
      in AD. However, whether ost can facilitate endogenous neurogenesis against AD in 
      vivo is still unknown. In this study, by using Morris water maze (MWM) test, 
      hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, Nissl staining, immunofluorescence analysis and 
      western blot, we demonstrated that oral administration of ost could improve the 
      learning and memory function, inhibit neuronal apoptosis, elevate the expression 
      of glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), synaptophysin (SYP) and 
      postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95). Moreover, ost could remarkably enhance 
      proliferation of NSCs and increase the amount of mature neurons in APP/PS1 
      transgenic mice. Together, our findings demonstrated that ost possessed the 
      ability of promoting endogenous neurogenesis and ost could be served as a 
      plausible agent to reverse or slow down the progress of AD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To research Angelica tenuissima Nakai (ATN) for use in novel 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics. METHODS: The effect of a 30% ethanol 
      extract of ATN (KH032) on AD-like cognitive impairment and neuropathological and 
      neuroinflammatory changes induced by bilateral intracerebroventricular injections 
      of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide (Aβ(1-42)) was investigated. Male C57Bl/6 mice were 
      randomly divided into 4 groups, 10 in each group. KH032-treated groups were 
      administrated with a low or high dose of KH032 (50 and 200 mg/kg, respectively), 
      intragastrically for 16 days; distilled water was applied in the sham and 
      negative groups. Open fifield test, Y maze and Morris water maze test were used 
      for behavior test and cognitive ability. In addition, the neuroprotective effects 
      of KH032 in Aβ(1-42)-infused mice on the histopathological markers 
      [neuronspecific nuclear protein (NeuN), Aβ(1-42)] of neurodegeneration were 
      examined. The levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), NeuN, 
      phosphorylation extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/ERK, brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylation cAMP response element-binding 
      (CREB)/CREB protein expression were measured by Western blot. RESULTS: KH032 
      treatment ameliorated cognitive impairments, reduced the overexpression of 
      Aβ(1-42), and inhibited neuronal loss and neuroinflammatory response in the 
      Aβ(1-42)-infused mice. Moreover, KH032 treatment enhanced BDNF expression levels 
      in the hippocampus. Finally, KH032 treatment increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 
      and CREB, vital for ERK-CREB signaling. CONCLUSIONS: KH032 attenuated cognitive 
      defificits in the Aβ(1-42)-infused mice by increasing BDNF expression and ERK1/2 
      and CREB phosphorylation and inhibiting neuronal loss and neuroinflflammatory 
      response, suggesting that KH032 has therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative 
      disorders such as AD.

      Behavioral tests were performed after three weeks of gastric administration. 
      Immunofluorescence-labeled cells were used to observe the differentiation and 
      maturation of new nerve cells in the DG of the hippocampus and SVZ region. 
      qRT-PCR and Western blotting detected the expression of neurogenesis genes and 
      Wnt/β-catenin pathway-related proteins, respectively. RESULTS: On the Morris 
      water maze test, LME rats had significantly shortened movement trajectory on the 
      searching platform, reduced escape latency time, and increased residence time on 
      the original platform quadrant. In addition, more LME rats crossed the platform 
      when it was removed. Thus, LME can improve the spatial learning and memory of 
      Aβ-induced AD rats. On qRT-PCR, LME significantly increased Reelin, Nestin, and 
      Pax6 gene expressions, which regulate neurogenesis. Immunofluorescence showed 
      that LME could significantly increase BrdU(+), Dcx(+), BrdU(+)/Neun(+), 
      BrdU(+)/Dcx(+) cells in the DG and SVZ regions, thus promoting neurogenesis. LME 
      also reduced the number of Iba1(+) and Iba1(+)/BrdU(+) cells, thus reducing the 
      neuroinflammatory response. On Western blot, LME upregulated the Wnt/β-catenin 
      pathway by upregulating Wnt3a, β-catenin, Disheveled (Dvl), and p-GSK3β and 
      downregulating p-β-catenin and GSK3β. CONCLUSION: LME attenuates cognitive 
      impairment in Aβ-induced AD rats by promoting neurogenesis in the hippocampus and 
      SVZ region through upregulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

AB  - The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a ubiquitously expressed kinase 
      that acts through two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, to regulate protein 
      homeostasis, as well as long lasting forms of synaptic and behavioral plasticity. 
      Alteration of the mTOR pathway is classically involved in neurodegenerative 
      disorders, and it has been linked to dysregulation of cognitive functions and 
      affective states. However, information concerning the specific involvement of the 
      p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a downstream target of the mTORC1 pathway, in learning 
      and memory processes and in the regulation of affective states remains scant. To 
      fill this gap, we exposed adult male mice lacking S6K1 to a battery of behavioral 
      tests aimed at measuring their learning and memory capabilities by evaluating 
      reference memory and flexibility with the Morris water maze, and associative 
      memory using the contextual fear conditioning task. We also studied their 
      anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors by, respectively, performing elevated 
      plus maze, open field, light-dark emergence tests, and sucrose preference and 
      forced swim tests. We found that deleting S6K1 leads to a robust anxious 
      phenotype concomitant with associative learning deficits; these symptoms are 
      associated with a reduction of adult neurogenesis and neuronal atrophy in the 
      hippocampus. Collectively, these results provide grounds for the understanding of 
      anxiety reports after treatments with mTOR inhibitors and will be critical for 
      developing novel compounds targeting anxiety.

AB  - Chronic stress induces neuronal death and impairs hippocampal neurogenesis, thus 
      leading to cognitive deficits and depressive-like behaviors. Our previous studies 
      found that apelin-13, a novel neuropeptide, and its receptors can improve 
      cognitive impairment and depressive-like behaviors in rats, but its mechanism 
      remains unknown. The study aims to evaluate the underlying mechanism of apelin-13 
      on cognitive impairment and depressive-like behaviors. A 4-week chronic 
      unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) is used to establish a rat model of depression. 
      Apelin-13(2 ug/day) is administered daily to the rats during the last 1 week. 
      Depressive-like behaviors, including tail suspension test (TST) and sucrose 
      preference test (SPT), are performed. The cognitive functions are established by 
      identify index of novel objects recognition test (NORT) and the number of 
      crossing hidden platform in morris water maze (MWM). The neuronal death is 
      measured by popidium iodide (PI) and flow cytometry. The activity of superoxide 
      dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-PX) in the hippocampus are 
      determined. The protein expressions of p-AMPK, AMPK, BDNF, FNDC5 and PGC-1α are 
      examined. Golgi staining observed the spine dendritic arborization of the 
      hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) subregion. Results showed that apelin-13 
      improves cognitive impairment and ameliorates depressive-like behaviors. 
      Moreover, apelin-13 significantly inhibits neuronal death via 
      AMPK/PGC-1α/FNDC5/BDNF pathway. Taken together, apelin-13 could exert 
      antidepressant effects via protecting neuron functions, which might be related to 
      the activation of AMPK/PGC-1α/FNDC5/BDNF pathway.

TI  - 20(S)-protopanaxadiol and oleanolic acid ameliorate cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 
      transgenic mice by enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis.
PG  - 325-333

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent 
      neurodegenerative disorders. Enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis by promoting 
      proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) is a promising 
      therapeutic strategy for AD. 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD) and oleanolic acid (OA) 
      are small, bioactive compounds found in ginseng that can promote NSC 
      proliferation and neural differentiation in vitro. However, it is currently 
      unknown whether PPD or OA can attenuate cognitive deficits by enhancing 
      hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo in a transgenic APP/PS1 AD mouse model. Here, we 
      administered PPD or OA to APP/PS1 mice and monitored the effects on cognition and 
      hippocampal neurogenesis. METHODS: We used the Morris water maze, Y maze, and 
      open field tests to compare the cognitive capacities of treated and untreated 
      APP/PS1 mice. We investigated hippocampal neurogenesis using Nissl staining and 
      BrdU/NeuN double labeling. NSC proliferation was quantified by Sox2 labeling of 
      the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We used western blotting to determine the effects 
      of PPD and OA on Wnt/GSK3β/β-catenin pathway activation in the hippocampus. 
      RESULTS: Both PPD and OA significantly ameliorated the cognitive impairments 
      observed in untreated APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, PPD and OA significantly 
      promoted hippocampal neurogenesis and NSC proliferation. At the mechanistic 
      level, PPD and OA treatments resulted in Wnt/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway activation 
      in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: PPD and OA ameliorate cognitive deficits in 
      APP/PS1 mice by enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis, achieved by stimulating the 
      Wnt/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway. As such, PPD and OA are promising novel therapeutic 
      agents for the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common autoimmune disease. 
      Progressive depletion of the brain and spinal cord tissue appears at the onset of 
      the disease. Several studies have shown the increased size of the ventricles of 
      the brain and decreases in the area of the corpus callosum and the width of the 
      brain. Other important symptoms of this disease are cognitive, learning, and 
      memory disorders. AIM: The aim of this study was to compare morphometric, 
      histological, and functional changes in the demyelination model in both sexes. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, male and female Wistar rats 
      were studied in four experimental groups. Demyelination was induced by the 
      injection of ethidium bromide in the ventricular region. The chronic effect of 
      demyelination on spatial memory, movement, and coordination was investigated 
      using the Morris Water Maze (MWM), and clinical and balance beam tests, 
      respectively. Myelin degradation, cell death and neurogenesis were estimated 
      using Luxol Fast Blue staining and immunohistochemistry (Caspase-3 and Nestin 
      markers). In addition, morphometric findings were recorded for the brain and 
      hippocampus (weight, volume, length, width). RESULT: Demyelination increased the 
      time and distance index and decreased the residence time in the target quarter in 
      the water maze test (p < .001). It also increases the neuromuscular and modified 
      neurological severity score (p < .01). Demyelination increases caspase-3 
      (p < .05) expression and decreases Nestin expression (p < .001), which are 
      directly related to the extent of damage. CONCLUSION: This study showed an 
      interaction between hippocampal structural and functional networks in explaining 
      spatial learning and memory in the early stages of MS.

AB  - Dementia with Lewy body (DLB) is the second most common degenerative dementia 
      after Alzheimer's disease. There is no therapeutic drug for DLB currently. It's 
      urgent for us to understand the pathological mechanism of dementia mediated by 
      α-synuclein, as the main component of Lewy body. Here, we found that the A53T 
      α-synuclein transgenic mice showed decreased nesting behavior starting from the 
      age of 1 month. The results in Morris water maze test suggested that the 
      6-month-old mice had learning memory deficits. Golgi staining indicated that the 
      apical neuronal dendritic spines of hippocampal CA1 neurons were significantly 
      reduced in 6-month-old homozygotes and heterozygotes, although MAP2 protein 
      expression revealed no significant difference in the hippocampus among wild-type 
      mice, homozygotes and heterozygotes. In vitro, we proved mutant A53T α-synuclein 
      decreased the dendritic branches and dendrite spines on the embryonic mice 
      hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, Ki67 immunofluorescence staining identified 
      that the Ki67-positive cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and subventricular 
      zone were significantly reduced in 6-month-old homozygotes and heterozygotes, 
      compared with age-matched wild-type mice. Similarly, when 6-month-old mice were 
      injected with BrdU for one day, the immunostaining results also confirmed that 
      BrdU-positive cells were significantly reduced in homozygous and heterozygous 
      mice. Lastly, we transfected primary embryonic hippocampal neural stem cells with 
      lentivirus vector expressing A53T α-synuclein in vitro. Both BrdU staining and 
      Western blotting showed that A53T α-synuclein significantly decreased the 
      proliferation of embryonic neural stem cells. Taken together, these data suggest 
      that A53T α-synuclein can induce adult neurogenesis impairment and cognitive 
      dysfunction. The A53T α-synuclein transgenic mice may be used as an animal model 
      for DLB. Promoting adult neurogenesis may be a promising approach to treat DLB 
      pathogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common degenerative disease 
      characterized by cognitive impairment, memory decline, and language disorder for 
      which there is no effective treatment. Neurogenesis has been indicated in AD and 
      may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Targeting this pathway is a 
      new idea for the treatment of the disease. A recent study reveals that the 
      cellular prion protein (PrP), a receptor for Aβ oligomers, regulates 
      neurogenesis, and its elevated expression is related to cell differentiation. The 
      aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of 6D11 
      (PrP monoclonal antibody) via neurogenesis promotion in APP/PS1 transgenic mice 
      and Aβ-induced cell model of AD. METHODS: In the present study, 9-month-old male 
      APP/PS1 mice were injected with 6D11. Then, the Morris water maze was used to 
      examine the spatial learning and memory abilities of the mice in both groups, and 
      immunostained was used to assess the level of Aβ, neurogenesis, and neural stem 
      cells (NSCs) differentiation. RESULTS: 6D11 attenuated cognitive deficits in 
      APP/PS1 transgenic mice, which was accompanied by a decrease of the deposition of 
      Aβ. In addition, 6D11 treatment promoted differentiation of the existing 
      hippocampal cells to neurons. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirmed that 6D11 has a 
      therapeutic effect in APP/PS1 transgenic AD mouse model and Aβ-induced AD cell 
      model, and the effect exerted via increase of neurogenesis and cell 
      differentiation by transduction of Aβ peptide signal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Impairment in neurogenesis correlates with memory and  cognitive 
      dysfunction in AD patients. In the recent decade, therapies with stem cell bases 
      are growing and proved to be efficient. This study is a preliminary attempt to 
      explore the impact of NTF-SCs on hippocampal neurogenesis mediated by the 
      Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade in AD-like mouse brain parenchyma. METHODS: The 
      BALB/c mice were divided into four groups: Control, AD +Vehicle, AD+ TF-SCs-CM 
      and AD+NTF-SCs (n = 10). For AD induction, 100 µM Aβ(1-42) was injected into 
      lateral ventricles. The AD-like model was confirmed via passive avoidance test 
      and Thioflavin-S staining 21 days following Aβ injection. Next, NTF-SCs were 
      differentiated from ADMSCs, and both NTF-SCs and supernatant (NTF-SCs-CM) were 
      injected into the hippocampus after AD confirmation. Endogenous neural stem cells 
      (NSCs) proliferation capacity was assessed after 50 mg/kbW BrdU injection for 
      4 days using immunofluorescence (IF) staining. The percent of BrdU/Nestin and 
      BrdU/NeuN positive NSCs were calculated. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect 
      genes related to the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade. The spatial learning and 
      memory alternation was evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM). RESULTS: Data 
      showed the reduction in escape latency over 5 days in the AD mice compared to the 
      control group. The administration of NTF-SCs and NTF-SCs-CM increased this value 
      compared to the AD-Vehicle group. Both NTF-SCs and NTF-SCs-CM were the potential 
      to reduce the cumulative distance to the platform in AD mice compared to the 
      AD-Vehicle group. The time spent in target quadrants was ameliorated following 
      NTF-SCs and NTF-SCs-CM transplantation followed by an improved MWM performance. 
      IF imaging revealed the increase in BrdU/Nestin(+) and BrdU/NeuN(+) in AD mice 
      that received NTF-SCs and NTF-SCs-CM, indicating enhanced neurogenesis. Based on 
      real-time PCR analysis, the expression of PI3K, Akt, MAPK, ERK, Wnt, and 
      β-catenin was upregulated and coincided with the suppression of GSK-3β after 
      injection of NTF-SCs-CM and NTF-SCs. In this study, NTF-SCs had superior effects 
      in AD mice that received NTF-SCs compared to NTF-SCs-CM. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway via NTF-SCs can be touted as a possible 
      therapeutic approach to restore neurogenesis in AD mice.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cognitive decline is one of the most prevalent health problems and is 
      associated with increased healthcare utilization and economic burden. Physical 
      and cognitive training both have positive effects on cognition but have been less 
      applied in combination. We hypothesized that simultaneous cognitive-physical 
      components would yield greater cognitive benefits than single-domain 
      interventions in rats. METHODS: A total of 40 male Wistar rats were divided into 
      four treatment groups: the control, enriched environment (EE), exercise (EX), and 
      EE + EX. Animals in EE groups housed in the large cages (50 × 50 × 50 cm) 
      contained differently shaped objects for 3 weeks. EX animals were forced to run 
      on a treadmill once daily for 3 consecutive weeks. Morris water maze test was 
      used for the assessment of spatial learning and memory. Real-time PCR was 
      performed to assess the expression of nestin, and Sox2 in the hippocampus. 
      RESULTS: EX and EE animals separately did not show a significantly enhanced 
      function in spatial memory in comparison with the control group. When animals 
      were treated with EE and EX simultaneously, they exhibited significantly superior 
      performance in spatial memory than control, EX, or EE groups separately. The 
      hippocampal expression of Sox2 was significantly higher in EE + EX group than in 
      the control, EX, and EE alone. CONCLUSIONS: These results may have clinical 
      implications for behavioral interventions in conditions with cognitive 
      deficiencies.

TI  - Isoflurane and Sevoflurane Induce Cognitive Impairment in Neonatal Rats by 
      Inhibiting Neural Stem Cell Development Through Microglial Activation, 
      Neuroinflammation, and Suppression of VEGFR2 Signaling Pathway.
PG  - 775-790

AB  - Inhaled anesthetics are known to induce neurotoxicity in the developing brains of 
      rodents, although the mechanisms are not well understood. The aim of this study 
      was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying anesthetics-induced 
      neurodevelopmental toxicity by VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) through the interaction 
      between microglia and neural stem cells (NSCs) in postnatal day 7 (P7) rats. 
      Cognitive function of P7 rats exposed to isoflurane and sevoflurane were assessed 
      using Morris Water Maze and T maze tests. We also evaluated the expression levels 
      of NSC biomarkers (Nestin and Sox2), microglia biomarker (CD11b or or IBA1), 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α), and VEGFR2 using western blotting 
      and immunohistochemistry in the brains of control and anesthesia-treated rats. We 
      found spatial learning and working memory was impaired 2 weeks after anesthetics 
      exposure in rats. Isoflurane induced stronger and more prolonged neurotoxicity 
      than sevoflurane. However, cognitive functions were recovered 6 weeks after 
      anesthesia. Isoflurane and sevoflurane decreased the levels of Nestin, Sox2, and 
      p-VEGFR2, activated microglia, decreased the number of NSCs and reduced 
      neurogenesis and the proliferation of NSCs, and increased the levels of IL-6, 
      TNF-α, and CD11b. Our results suggested that isoflurane and sevoflurane induced 
      cognitive impairment in rats by inhibiting NSC development and neurogenesis via 
      microglial activation, neuroinflammation, and suppression of VEGFR2 signaling 
      pathway.

TI  - Low Skeletal Muscle Mass Is Associated With Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorder 
      Due To Decreased Neurogenesis in Rats.
PG  - 194-203
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000005681 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a postsurgical 
      complication associated with neuroinflammation and impaired hippocampal 
      neurogenesis, in which brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a key role. 
      Sarcopenia refers to age-related muscle loss that causes cognitive decline, 
      muscle atrophy, and postoperative delirium. Rats with tail suspension (TS) were 
      used to represent a low-activity model, which involves decreased hind limb 
      function by TS. This hind limb unloading by TS can induce sarcopenia in 2 weeks. 
      However, the relationship between PND and muscle atrophy is unclear. In this 
      experiment, we investigated whether preoperative muscle atrophy induced by TS 
      would affect neurogenesis and accelerate PND in rats. METHODS: Sixty 21-week-old 
      rats were assigned to 4 groups: the TS group, the TS with surgery (TS + S) group, 
      the control group, and the control with surgery (control + S) group. After the 
      abdominal manipulation under 3% sevoflurane anesthesia, cognitive function was 
      assessed using the Morris water maze test and a fear-conditioning test. 
      Neurogenesis was evaluated by checking BDNF secretion and immunohistochemical 
      staining in the hippocampus. RESULTS: The TS + S group showed impaired swimming 
      latency (difference of means = 12.4 versus control + S; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 2.0-22.7; P = .016) (difference of means = 15.2 versus TS; 95% CI, 
      0.4-30.1; P = .043) and path length (difference of means = 147.8 versus control + 
      S; 95% CI, 20.7-274.9; P = .020) in the maze test and cued fear memory 
      (difference of means = -26.0 versus TS; 95% CI, -46.4 to -5.6; P = .006) 
      (difference of means = -22.3 versus control + S; 95% CI, -42.7 to -1.9; P = .026) 
      in the fear-conditioning test. The postoperative levels of BDNF in the TS + S and 
      TS groups were reduced compared with the other groups (P = .002). The number of 
      neural precursors in the dentate gyrus was significantly lower in the TS + S 
      group (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that preoperative hind limb muscle 
      atrophy, indicated by TS, was associated with an increased occurrence of PND 
      through the reduction in BDNF and neurogenesis after abdominal surgery in young 
      adult rats. Therefore, we concluded that preoperative low skeletal muscle mass 
      can induce PND due to impaired postoperative neurogenesis. Our findings might 
      indicate that low-cost perioperative interventions, such as preoperative 
      exercise, is beneficial to preventing PND.

TI  - Nuclear receptor TLX may be through regulating the SIRT1/NF-κB pathway to 
      ameliorate cognitive impairment in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a common pathophysiological 
      mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular 
      dementia. The orphan nuclear receptor TLX plays an important role in neural 
      development, adult neurogenesis and cognition. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the neuroprotective effects of TLX on cognitive dysfunction, 
      hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroinflammation in a rat model of CCH and to 
      assess the possible mechanisms. METHODS: Permanent bilateral common carotid 
      artery occlusion (2-VO) was used to establish a model of CCH. Stereotaxic 
      injection of an adeno-associated virus vector expressing TLX was used to 
      overexpress TLX in the hippocampus. Cognitive function was evaluated by the 
      Morris Water Maze test. Immunofluorescent staining was used to assess hippocampal 
      neurogenesis. The effects of overexpression of TLX on SIRT1 and inflammatory 
      cytokines were analyzed with qRT-PCR and western blot. RESULT: After 2-VO, CCH 
      rats exhibited cognitive impairment and reduction of hippocampal TLX levels. 
      Overexpression of TLX ameliorated cognitive impairments with increasing number of 
      BrdU + cells and BrdU + NeuN + cells in DG. Furthermore, TLX rescued the reduced 
      SIRT1 usually induced by CCH. Additionally, TLX also inhibited the expression of 
      inflammatory cytokines such as NF-κB and IL-1β. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings 
      suggested that TLX exerted protective effects against cognitive deficits induced 
      by CCH. The possible mechanisms of TLX may be through regulating the SIRT1/NF-κB 
      pathway, promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and inhibiting the neuroinflammatory 
      response.

AB  - Cognitive decline is one of the most obvious symptoms of traumatic brain injury 
      (TBI). Previous studies have demonstrated that cognitive decline is related to 
      substantially increased neuroinflammation and decreased neurogenesis in the 
      hippocampus in a rat model of TBI. Using this model, we explored the role of 
      curcumin (Cur) in ameliorating TBI-impaired spatial memory because Cur has been 
      shown to exhibit anti-chronic-neuroinflammatory, neurogenesis-promoting, and 
      memory-improving properties. Animals received daily Cur or vehicle treatment for 
      28 days after TBI and also received 50-bromodeoxyuridine(BrdU) for the first 7 
      days of the treatment for assaying neurogenesis. An optimal Cur dose of 30 mg/kg, 
      selected from a range of 10-50 mg/kg, was used for the present study. 
      Neuroinflammation was evaluated by astrocyte hypertrophy, activated microglia, 
      and inflammatory factors in the hippocampus. Behavioral water-maze studies were 
      conducted for 5 days, starting at 35-day post-TBI. The tropomyosin receptor 
      kinase B (Trkb) inhibitor, ANA-12, was used to test the role of the brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/ TrkB/Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling 
      pathway in regulating inflammation and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Treatment 
      with Cur ameliorated the spatial memory of TBI rats, reduced TBI-induced chronic 
      inflammation, typified by diminished astrocyte hypertrophy, reduction in 
      activated microglia, declined inflammatory factors, and increased neurogenesis in 
      the hippocampus. We also found that BDNF/Trkb/PI3K/Akt signaling was involved in 
      the effects of Cur in TBI rats. Thus, Cur treatment can ameliorate the spatial 
      memory in a murine model of TBI, which may be attributable to decreased chronic 
      neuroinflammation, increased hippocampal neurogenesis, and/or BDNF/Trkb/PI3K/Akt 
      signaling.

TI  - Combined long-term enriched environment and caffeine supplementation improve 
      memory function in C57Bl6 mice.
LID - 10.1007/s00406-022-01431-7 [doi]
AB  - Regular physical activity has been associated with healthy brain aging, reflected 
      by beneficial effects on cognition and learning and memory. Nutritional 
      supplements such as caffeine have been shown to act as cognitive enhancers and 
      may possess neuroprotective properties. Interestingly, caffeine also improves 
      athletic capabilities and is widely used by athletes because of its 
      performance-enhancing effect, while information on potential additive beneficial 
      effects of physical activity and caffeine on cognitive performance is scarce. In 
      the present study, the effects of caffeine supplementation in combination with 
      prolonged physical and cognitive stimulation in the form of the enriched 
      environment (EE) housing for a duration of 4 months were analyzed. We demonstrate 
      that caffeine supplementation together with prolonged environmental enrichment 
      led to enhanced memory function, resulting in improved recognition and spatial 
      working memory in behavioral paradigms such as the novel object recognition task 
      or the Morris water maze in C57Bl6 wild-type mice. Mice housed under EE 
      conditions showed increased gene expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. The present findings underscore the potential 
      impact of continuous physical activity in the prevention of age-related cognitive 
      decline and may offer new options for combinatorial approaches.

AB  - Memory-enhancing agents have long been required for various reasons such as for 
      obtaining a good score in a test in the young and for retaining memory in the 
      aged. Although many studies have found that several natural products may be good 
      candidates for memory enhancement, there is still a need for better agents. The 
      present study investigated whether rubrofusarin, an active ingredient in Cassiae 
      semen, enhances learning and memory in normal mice. Passive avoidance and Morris 
      water maze tests were performed to determine the memory-enhancing ability of 
      rubrofusarin. To investigate synaptic function, hippocampal long-term 
      potentiation (LTP) was measured. Western blotting was performed to determine 
      protein levels. To investigate neurite outgrowth, DCX immunohistochemistry and 
      cell culture were utilised. Rubrofusarin (1, 3, 10, 30 mg/kg) enhanced memory in 
      passive avoidance and Morris water maze tests. Moreover, rubrofusarin ameliorated 
      scopolamine-induced memory impairment. In the rubrofusarin-treated group, 
      high-frequency stimulation induced higher LTP in the hippocampal 
      Schaffer-collateral pathway compared to the control group. The 
      rubrofusarin-treated group showed a higher number of DCX-positive immature 
      neurons with an increase in the length of dendrites compared to the control group 
      in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region. In vitro experiments showed that 
      rubrofusarin facilitated neurite outgrowth in neuro2a cells through extracellular 
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Finally, we found that extracellular 
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is required for rubrofusarin-induced enhancement of 
      neurite outgrowth, learning and memory. These results demonstrate that 
      rubrofusarin enhances learning and memory and neurite outgrowth, and these might 
      need activation of ERK pathway.

AB  - Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high rate of mortality and 
      morbidity, but lacks effective therapies. Accumulating studies indicated that the 
      hippocampal neurogenesis plays an essential role in the recovery of neurological 
      function after ICH. The Notch1 signaling pathway shows important roles in 
      neurogenesis. However, the effects of Notch1 on the recovery of neurological 
      function after ICH remain unclear. Here, we used ICH mice model to investigate 
      whether Notch1 signaling was involved in the hippocampal neurogenesis and the 
      recovery of neurological function post-ICH. Our results showed that the rate of 
      symmetric division pattern of hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) decreased 
      significantly at 3 days after ICH. Meanwhile, the expression of Notch1 in the 
      hippocampus also was reduced significantly. However, Notch1 activator treatment 
      enhanced the expression of Notch1 and increased the number of Sox2+GFAP+ cells. 
      Further, the rate of symmetric division pattern of NSCs also increased after 
      Notch1 activator treatment in mice with ICH. Importantly, the number of DCX+ 
      cells and BrdU+NeuN+ in hippocampus were increased on 28 days post-ICH as the 
      Notch1 expression was upregulated. The motor function and spatial memory ability 
      in post-ICH mice following Notch1 activator treatment also were improved. Taken 
      together, our results suggested that Notch1 signaling could influence the 
      recovery of long-term neurological function by regulating the proliferation and 
      differentiation of the hippocampal NSCs in mice after ICH. Our study may provide 
      ideas for the improvement of neurological function and spatial memory defects 
      after ICH.

AB  - tDCS, a new, safe, non-invasive physical therapy method, is often used in motor

      This study aimed to investigate the promotive effect and mechanism of repetitive

      was established using bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). The 
      pathological changes in the hippocampal CA1 region and cognitive function were 
      assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and Morris water maze test, 
      respectively. Hippocampal neurogenesis was observed by immunofluorescence 
      staining. The levels of expression of ephrinb1, EPHB2, MAP-2, and NMDAR in the 
      hippocampi were analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Compared with the sham 
      mice, the model mice showed significant neuronal damage in the hippocampal CA1 
      region (P < 0.01), cognitive dysfunction (P < 0.01), and endogenous hippocampal 
      neurogenesis (P < 0.01). These results suggested that the CI model was 
      successfully established, and that CI could promote endogenous hippocampal 
      neurogenesis, but this hippocampal neurogenesis was unable to recover cognitive 
      dysfunction. Compared with the model mice, the tDCS mice had ameliorated 
      pathological damage in the CA1 region (P < 0.01), improved cognitive function 
      (P < 0.01), increased hippocampal neurogenesis (P < 0.01), and increased mRNA and 
      protein expression of ephrinb1, EPHB2, MAP-2, and NMDAR (P < 0.05). Repetitive 
      anodal-tDCS can promote hippocampal neurogenesis and improve cognitive function 
      in CI mice. The effect may be related to the activation of the 
      ephrinb1/EPHB2/MAP-2/NMDAR signaling pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Enhancing phagocytosis can facilitate the removal of 
      inflammatory molecules, limit the toxicity of dead cells and debris, and promote 
      recovery after brain injury. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of 
      bexarotene (Bex), a retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist, in promoting astrocyte 
      phagocytosis and neurobehavioral recovery after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). 
      METHODS: Mice SAH model was induced by pre-chiasmatic injection of blood. 
      Modified Garcia score, novel object recognition, rotarod test, and Morris water 
      maze were performed to assess neurological function. Immunofluorescence and 
      electron microscopy were used to evaluate astrocyte phagocytosis in vivo. In 
      addition， ABCA1/MEGF10&GULP1, the primary astrocyte phagocytosis pathway, were 
      stimulated by Bex or suppressed by HX531 (a RXR antagonist) to evaluate their 
      impacts on astrocyte phagocytosis and neurological recovery. RESULTS: Astrocytes 
      phagocytosis of blood components were observed in mice after SAH induction, which 
      is further increased by Bex treatment. Bex dramatically attenuated 
      neuroinflammation, reduced brain edema, improved early neurological performance 
      and promoted neurocognitive recovery. Meanwhile, Bex decreased neurotoxic 
      reactive astrocytes and preserved neurogenesis after SAH. Bex increased the 
      expression of astrocyte phagocytosis-related proteins ABCA1, MEGF10, and GULP1. 
      Bex also increased the lysosomal processing of engulfed blood components in 
      astrocytes. Moreover, Bex significantly promoted astrocytes to phagocytize debris 
      in vitro by increasing the expression of ABCA1, MEGF10 and GULP1, while HX531 
      inhibited astrocyte phagocytosis and decreased these protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Bex enhanced astrocyte phagocytosis through the ABCA1-mediated pathways, and 
      promoted neurobehavior recovery in mice after SAH induction.

      behavioral disorders induced by prenatal valproate exposure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Valproic acid (VPA) is a clinically used antiepileptic drug, but it 
      is associated with a significant risk of a low verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) 
      score, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder in 
      children when it is administered during pregnancy. Prenatal VPA exposure has been 
      reported to affect neurogenesis and neuronal migration and differentiation. In 
      addition, growing evidence has shown that microglia and brain immune cells are 
      activated by VPA treatment. However, the role of VPA-activated microglia remains 
      unclear. METHODS: Pregnant female mice received sodium valproate on E11.5. A 
      microglial activation inhibitor, minocycline or a CCR5 antagonist, maraviroc was 
      dissolved in drinking water and administered to dams from P1 to P21. Measurement 
      of microglial activity, evaluation of neural circuit function and expression 
      analysis were performed on P10. Behavioral tests were performed in the order of 
      open field test, Y-maze test, social affiliation test and marble burying test 
      from the age of 6 weeks. RESULTS: Prenatal exposure of mice to VPA induced 
      microglial activation and neural circuit dysfunction in the CA1 region of the 
      hippocampus during the early postnatal periods and post-developmental defects in 
      working memory and social interaction and repetitive behaviors. Minocycline, a 
      microglial activation inhibitor, clearly suppressed the above effects, suggesting 
      that microglia elicit neural dysfunction and behavioral disorders. 
      Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed that the expression of a chemokine, 
      C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3), was upregulated in the hippocampi of 
      VPA-treated mice. CCL3 expression increased in microglia during the early 
      postnatal periods via an epigenetic mechanism. The CCR5 antagonist maraviroc 
      significantly suppressed neural circuit dysfunction and post-developmental 
      behavioral disorders induced by prenatal VPA exposure. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      suggest that microglial CCL3 might act during development to contribute to 
      VPA-induced post-developmental behavioral abnormalities. CCR5-targeting compounds 
      such as maraviroc might alleviate behavioral disorders when administered early.

TI  - Simvastatin Attenuates Neurogenetic Damage and Improves Neurocongnitive Deficits 
      Induced by Isoflurane in Neonatal Rats.
PG  - 618-632
LID - 10.1159/000488630 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Isoflurane inhibited neurogenesis and induced subsequent 
      neurocognitive deficits in developing brain. Simvastatin exerts neuroprotection 
      in a wide range of brain injury models. In the present study, we investigated 
      whether simvastatin could attenuate neurogenetic inhibition and cognitive 
      deficits induced by isoflurane exposure in neonatal rats. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley 
      rats at postnatal day (PND) 7 and neural stem cells (NSCs) were treated with 
      either gas mixture, isoflurane, or simvastatin 60 min prior to isoflurane 
      exposure, respectively. The rats were decapitated at PND 8 and PND 10 for 
      detection of neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone 
      (SGZ) of the hippocampus by immunostaining. NSC proliferation, viability and 
      apoptosis were assessed by immunohistochemistry, CCK-8 and TUNEL, respectively. 
      The protein expressions of caspase-3, p-Akt and p-GSK-3β both in vivo and vitro 
      were assessed by western blotting. Cognitive functions were assessed by Morris 
      Water Maze test and context fear conditioning test at the adult. RESULTS: 
      Isoflurane exposure inhibited neurogenesis in the SVZ and SGZ, decreased NSC 
      proliferation and viability, promoted NSC apoptosis and led to late cognitive 
      deficits. Furthermore, isoflurane increased caspase-3 expression and decreased 
      protein expressions of p-Akt and p-GSK-3β both in vivo and in vitro. Pretreatment 
      with simvastatin attenuated isoflurane-elicited changes in NSCs and cognitive 
      function. Co-treatment with LY294002 reversed the effect of simvastatin on NSCs 
      in vitro. CONCLUSION: We for the first time showed that simvastatin, by 
      upregulating Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway, alleviated isoflurane-induced 
      neurogenetic damage and neurocognitive deficits in developing rat brain.

AB  - Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a crucial receptor in neuroinflammation and 
      apoptotic neuronal death, and increasing evidences indicated that 
      β2-microglobulin (B2M) is thought to be a major contributor to age-related 
      cognitive decline. In present study, we designed to investigate the effects of 
      TLR4 on B2M-induced age-related cognitive decline. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6, TLR4 
      knockout (TLR4 -KO) mice and hippocampal neurons from the two type mice were 
      respectively divided into two groups: (1) Veh group; (2) B2M-treated group. The 
      behavioral responses of mice were measured using Morris Water Maze. Hippocampal 
      neurogenesis and neuronal damage, inflammatory response, apoptosis, synaptic 
      proteins and neurotrophic factors, and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway 
      proteins were examined using molecular biological or histopathological methods. 
      The results showed that WT mice received B2M in the DG exhibited age-related 
      cognitive declines, increased TLR4 mRNA expression and high levels of 
      interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and apoptotic 
      neuronal death in the hippocampus, which were partially attenuated in TLR4-KO 
      mice. Moreover, in absence of TLR4, B2M treatment improved hippocampus 
      neurogenesis and increased synaptic related proteins. Our cell experiments 
      further demonstrated that deletion of TLR4 could significantly increase synaptic 
      related protein, decrease neuroinflammatory fators, inhibited apoptotic neuronal 
      death, and regulated MyD88/NF-κB signal pathway after B2M treatment. In summary, 
      our results support the TLR4 contributes to B2M-induced age-related cognitive 
      decline due to neuroinflammation and apoptosis through TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling 
      pathway via a modulation of hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic function. This 
      may provide an important neuroprotective mechanism for improving age-related 
      cognitive decline.

AB  - We have previously reported that the miR-181a/Prox1/Notch1 pathway mediates the 
      effect of morphine on modulating lineage-specific differentiation of adult neural 
      stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) via a PKCε-dependent pathway, whereas fentanyl 
      shows no such effect. However, the role of the PKCε/Prox1 pathway in mediating 
      drug-associated contextual memory remains unknown. The current study investigated 
      the effect of PKCε/Prox1 on morphine-induced inhibition of adult neurogenesis and 
      drug-associated contextual memory in mice, while the effect of fentanyl was 
      tested simultaneously. By using BrdU labeling, we were able to examine the 
      lineages of differentiated NSPCs in adult DG. PKCε knockout blocked morphine's 
      effects on inducing in vivo astrocyte-preferential differentiation of NSPCs, but 
      did not alter NSPC lineages upon fentanyl treatment. Inhibited adult neurogenesis 
      further resulted in prolonged extinction and enhanced reinstatement of 
      morphine-induced CPP, as well as prolonged extinction of space reference memory 
      indicated by the Morris water maze paradigm. However, after fentanyl 
      administration, no significant changes were found between wild-type and PKCε 
      knockout mice, during either CPP or water maze tasks. When the lentivirus 
      encoding Nestin-promoter-controlled Prox1 cDNA was injected into hippocampi of 
      wildtype and PKCε knockout adult mice to modulate PKCε/Prox1 activity, similar 
      effects were discovered in adult mice injected with lentivirus encoding Prox1, 
      and more dramatic effects were found in PKCε knockout mice with concurrent Prox1 
      overexpression. In conclusion, morphine mediates lineage-specific NSPC 
      differentiation, inhibits adult neurogenesis and regulates contextual memory 
      retention via the PKCε/Prox1 pathway, which are implicated in the eventual 
      context-associated relapse.

AB  - Ketamine exposure disturbed normal neurogenesis in the developing brain and 
      resulted in subsequent neurocognitive deficits. 17β-estradiol provides robust 
      neuroprotection in a variety of brain injury models in animals of both sexes and 
      attenuates neurodegeneration induced by anesthesia agents. In the present study, 
      we aimed to investigate whether 17β-estradiol could attenuate neonatal ketamine 
      exposure-disturbed neurogenesis and behavioral performance. We treated 7-day-old 
      (Postnatal day 7, PND 7) Sprague-Dawley rats and neural stem cells (NSCs) with 
      either normal saline, ketamine, or 17β-estradiol before/after ketamine exposure, 
      respectively. At PND 14, the rats were decapitated to detect neurogenesis in the 
      subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus by 
      immunofluorescence staining. The proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and 
      apoptosis of NSCs were assessed by immunohistochemistry method and TUNEL assay, 
      respectively. The protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 in vivo in addition to 
      GSK-3β and p-GSK-3β in vitro were examined by western blotting. Spatial learning 
      and memory abilities were assessed by Morris water maze (MWM) test at PND 42-47. 
      Ketamine exposure decreased cell proliferation in the SVZ and SGZ, inhibited NSC 
      proliferation and neuronal differentiation, promoted NSC apoptosis and led to 
      adult cognitive deficits. Furthermore, ketamine increased cleaved caspase-3 in 
      vivo and decreased the expression of p-GSK-3β in vitro. Treatment with 
      17β-estradiol could attenuate ketamine-induced changes both in vivo and in vitro. 
      For the first time we showed that 17β-estradiol alleviated ketamine-induced 
      neurogenesis inhibition and cognitive dysfunction in the developing rat brain. 
      Moreover, the protection of 17β-estradiol was associated with GSK-3β.

TI  - Enriched environment priors to TET1 hippocampal administration for regulating 
      psychiatric behaviors via glial reactivity in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion 
      models.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) has been gradually regarded as a 
      common etiologic mechanism for cognitive and psychiatric disturbances. Ten-eleven 
      translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) played an important role in 
      adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), neuronal circuits formation, cognition and 
      psychiatric disorders. Enriched environment (EE) showed a beneficial effect on 
      cognition and depression via effectively regulating AHN and glial reactivity. 
      This study aimed to assess which strategy was feasible to improve cognition and 
      psychiatric disturbances by comparing the TET1 hippocampal microinjection and EE 
      in CCH models and to investigate the possible mechanisms. METHOD: CCH rats were 
      established via permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2-VO). Rats 
      were stereotaxically injected with the human catalytic domain of TET1 (hTET1) to 
      overexpress the hTET1 in the hippocampus 10 days before 2-VO. 3 days after 2-VO, 
      rats were subjected to standard environment or EE with free access to food and 
      water. Behavioral tests were used to appraise depression and cognition before 
      sacrifice. Epigenetic molecules, adult neurogenesis, synaptic proteins 
      expression, and glial activation were analyzed using immunofluorescent staining, 
      qRT-PCR and western blot. RESULTS: In the present study, we found both EE and 
      genetical treatment with overexpressing hTET1 were sufficient for stimulating 
      AHN. However, promoting ANH could not deal with the cognitive dysfunction and 
      depressive-like behaviors in CCH rats. Notably, a healthy local brain environment 
      with elevated BDNF and astrocytes was conducive to improving cognitive 
      dysfunction. Meanwhile, astrocytes were involved in the cognitive regulating 
      process of neurons, presynaptic function and microglia. In general, we held that 
      depressive disturbances were determined by BDNF levels, neuronal and presynaptic 
      function, as well as glial activation containing astrocytes and microglia. To 
      further support this point, we investigated severe depressive symptoms that were 
      strongly correlated with the activation of astroglia and microglia. Importantly, 
      causal mediation analysis showed significant mediation by the presence of 
      reactive glial cells in the relation between neural plasticity and depressive 
      symptoms. Finally, we showed EE performed better than hTET1 treatment for 
      cognitive deficits and depression. EE with less glial reactivity was much more 
      resistant to depression, while hTET1 with more glial activation was more 
      vulnerable to depressive disorders. CONCLUSIONS: EE was likely to be superior to 
      TET1 hippocampal administration for cognition and psychiatric behaviors in CCH 
      rats. Furthermore, a healthy local brain environment with elevated BDNF and 
      astrocytes was conducive to improving cognitive dysfunction. More glial 
      activation, and more vulnerable to depressive disorders. These results were 
      important for our understanding of disease mechanisms and provided valuable tools 
      for the overall management of CCH patients.

AB  - Background: Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors are positively 
      allosterically modulated by benzodiazepine binding, leading to a potentiated 
      response to GABA. Diazepam (DZP, a benzodiazepine) is widely prescribed for 
      anxiety, epileptic discharge, and insomnia, and is also used as a muscle relaxant 
      and anti-convulsant. However, some adverse effects - such as tolerance, 
      dependence, withdrawal effects, and impairments in cognition and learning - are 
      elicited by the long-term use of DZP. Clinical studies have reported that chronic 
      DZP treatment increases the risk of dementia in older adults. Furthermore, 
      several studies have reported that chronic DZP administration may affect neuronal 
      activity in the hippocampus, dendritic spine structure, and cognitive 
      performance. However, the effects of chronic DZP administration on cognitive 
      function in aged mice is not yet completely understood. Methods: A behavioral 
      test, immunohistochemical analysis of neurogenic and apoptotic markers, dendritic 
      spine density analysis, and long-term potentiation (LTP) assay of the hippocampal 
      CA1 and CA3 were performed in both young (8 weeks old) and middle-aged (12 months 
      old) mice to investigate the effects of chronic DZP administration on cognitive 
      function. The chronic intraperitoneal administration of DZP was performed by 
      implanting an osmotic minipump. To assess spatial learning and memory ability, 
      the Morris water maze test was performed. Dendritic spines were visualized using 
      Lucifer yellow injection into the soma of hippocampal neurons, and spine density 
      was analyzed. Moreover, the effects of exercise on DZP-induced changes in spine 
      density and LTP in the hippocampus were assessed. Results: Learning performance 
      was impaired by chronic DZP administration in middle-aged mice but not in young 
      mice. LTP was attenuated by DZP administration in the CA1 of young mice and the 
      CA3 of middle-aged mice. The spine density of hippocampal neurons was decreased 
      by chronic DZP administration in the CA1 of both young and middle-aged mice as 
      well as in the CA3 of middle-aged mice. Neither neurogenesis nor apoptosis in the 
      hippocampus was affected by chronic DZP administration. Conclusion: The results 
      of this study suggest that the effects of chronic DZP are different between young 
      and middle-aged mice. The chronic DZP-induced memory retrieval performance 
      impairment in middle-aged mice can likely be attributed to decreased LTP and 
      dendritic spine density in hippocampal neurons in the CA3. Notably, prophylactic 
      exercise suppressed the adverse effects of chronic DZP on LTP and spine 
      maintenance in middle-aged mice.

AB  - Jieyu Anshen granule (JY) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula for treating 
      depression and anxiety. The aim of the study was to observe the effects of JY on 
      poststroke depression (PSD) and investigate the underlying mechanism. PSD rat 
      model was developed by middle cerebral artery occlusion following chronic 
      unpredictable mild stress in conjunction with isolation rearing. We performed 
      behavioral tests, Western blot, ELISA, and BrdU/NeuN staining. Treatment with JY 
      showed significant antidepressant effect in open-field and sucrose preference 
      tests, as well as significant improvement in beam-walking, cylinder, grip 
      strength, and water maze tests. In addition, treatment with JY could restore the 
      levels of neurotransmitters and decrease the levels of hormone and inflammation 
      cytokines in serum and brain. Treatment with JY also showed significant 
      regulation in the expression of neurotransmitter receptors and NF-κB/IκB-α 
      signaling in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, the numbers of 
      newborn neurons in the hippocampus were increased by treatment with JY. Our 
      results suggest that JY could ameliorate PSD and improve the neurological and 
      cognitive functions. The antidepressive effect may be associated with the 
      modulation of JY on monoamine system, neuroendocrine, neuroinflammation, and 
      neurogenesis.

AB  - Studies have shown that the natural flavonoid luteolin has neurotrophic activity. 
      In this study, we investigated the effect of luteolin in a mouse model of Down 
      syndrome. Ts65Dn mice, which are frequently used as a model of Down syndrome, 
      were intraperitoneally injected with 10 mg/kg luteolin for 4 consecutive weeks 
      starting at 12 weeks of age. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate 
      learning and memory abilities, and the novel object recognition test was used to 
      assess recognition memory. Immunohistochemistry was performed for the neural stem 
      cell marker nestin, the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein, the 
      immature neuron marker DCX, the mature neuron marker NeuN, and the cell 
      proliferation marker Ki67 in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Nissl staining was 
      used to observe changes in morphology and to quantify cells in the dentate gyrus. 
      Western blot assay was used to analyze the protein levels of brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 
      (p-ERK1/2) in the hippocampus. Luteolin improved learning and memory abilities as 
      well as novel object recognition ability, and enhanced the proliferation of 
      neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Furthermore, luteolin increased 
      expression of nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein, increased the number of 
      DCX(+) neurons in the granular layer and NeuN(+) neurons in the subgranular 
      region of the dentate gyrus, and increased the protein levels of BDNF and 
      p-ERK1/2 in the hippocampus. Our findings show that luteolin improves behavioral 
      performance and promotes hippocampal neurogenesis in Ts65Dn mice. Moreover, these 
      effects might be associated with the activation of the BDNF/ERK1/2 pathway.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the role of sex and ovarian hormones in 
      hippocampal damage and cognitive deficits and behavioral dysfunction in rats 
      induced by chronic exposure to hypobaric hypoxia. METHODS: Six-week-old male and 
      female SD rats were housed for 3 months either in a real altitude (4,250 m) 
      environment as the model of chronic hypobaric-hypoxia (CHH) or in a plain as 
      controls. The animal behavioral and hippocampal neurons at subcellular, 
      molecular, and ultrastructural levels were characterized after CHH exposure. 
      RESULTS: After 3 months of CHH exposure, (1) male CHH rats' serum testosterone 
      level was lower than male controls' whereas female CHH rats' serum estradiol 
      level was higher than female controls'; (2) Morris water maze test finds that 
      male rats showed more learning and spatial memory deficits than female rats; (3) 
      male rats showed more severe hippocampal damage, hippocampal inflammation, 
      oxidative stress and decreased hippocampal integrity (neurogenesis and dendritic 
      spine density) than female rats; (4) Western blot analysis shows that, compared 
      with the male control group, in male CHH group's hippocampus, expression of nNOS, 
      HO-1, and Bax protein increased whereas that of Bcl-2 protein decreased; (5) 
      Expression of PON2 protein in male rats (CHH and controls) was lower than female 
      rats (CHH and controls). In addition, CHH exposure decreased the expression of 
      PON2 protein in both male and female rats; (6) qPCR analysis reveals that CHH 
      exposure reduced the gene expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NR2A and 
      NR2B subunits in male rats' hippocampus. In addition, compared with the sham CHH 
      group, the expression level of PON2 protein decreased in the OVX-CHH group's 
      hippocampus whereas oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and degeneration of 
      hippocampal neurons increased in the OVX-CHH group's hippocampus. CONCLUSION: 
      After CHH exposure, male rats were significantly more likely than female rats to 
      develop hippocampal damage, hippocampal neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline 
      and deficits, suggesting that sex and ovarian hormones were significantly 
      involved in regulating the rats' susceptibility to CHH exposure-induced 
      hippocampal damage.

AB  - Recent research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) focuses on processes prior to 
      amyloid-beta plaque deposition accounting for the progress of the disease. 
      However, early mechanisms of AD are still poorly understood and predictors of the 
      disease in the pre-plaque stage essential for initiating an early therapy are 
      lacking. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and potentially 
      impaired cognition may serve as predictors and early clinical diagnostic markers 
      for AD. To investigate potential BPSD and cognitive impairments in association 
      with neuronal cell development as such markers for AD in the pre-plaque stage, 
      female APP23 mice at eight, 19 and 31 weeks of age and corresponding control 
      animals were tested for BPSD (elevated zero maze; sucrose preference test), motor 
      coordination (rotarod), spatial memory and reversal learning (Morris water maze) 
      and hippocampal neurogenesis as a neuronal correlate for hippocampus-dependent 
      behavior. To evaluate a potential therapeutic effect of physical, cognitive and 
      social stimulation, animals were exposed to environmental enrichment (EE) for 
      one, twelve or 24 weeks from five weeks of age. In APP23, decreased anxiety 
      accompanied increased agitation from eight weeks of age. Impairment of spatial 
      memory and learning flexibility prior to plaque deposition involved an 
      insufficient use of spatial search strategies associated with an unsuccessful 
      compensatory increase of neurogenesis. EE had an overall beneficial effect on 
      behavior and neurogenesis and thus constitutes a therapeutic tool to slow disease 
      progression. BPSD, cognition and associated impaired neurogenesis complement 
      clinical diagnostic markers for pre-plaque AD and contribute to an early 
      detection essential to halt disease progression.

LID - 10.1002/jdn.10042 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the present study, the effect of inducible nitric oxide (NO) 
      synthase inhibitor, aminoguanidine (AG) on neurogenesis indicators, learning and 
      memory, and oxidative stress status in juvenile hypothyroid (Hypo) rats was 
      evaluated. METHOD: The studied groups were including: (a) Control, (b) Hypo, 
      (c-e) Hypo-AG 10, Hypo-AG 20, and Hypo-AG 30. Hypothyroidism was induced in the 
      groups 2-5 by adding propylthiouracil in drinking water (0.05%). AG (10, 20, or 
      30 mg/kg) was daily injected intraperitoneally in the groups 3-5. The rats of the 
      groups 1 and 2 were injected by saline instead of AG. After 6 weeks treatment, 
      Morris water maze (MMW) and passive avoidance (PA) tests were done. Deep 
      anesthesia was then induced and the brain tissue was excised for biochemical 
      parameters measuring. RESULTS: Ki67 as a maker of neurogenesis and thiol, 
      superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) as oxidative stress indicators 
      were decreased in the brain of Hypo group, whereas malondialdehyde (MDA) and NO 
      metabolites were enhanced. AG improved Ki67, thiol, CAT, and SOD while decreased 
      MDA and NO metabolites. The escape latency in the MWM test increased in the Hypo 
      group. The spending time in the target quadrant in the probe test of MWM and 
      step-through latency in the PA test in the Hypo group was lower than Control 
      group. AG reversed all the negative behavioral effects of hypothyroidism. 
      CONCLUSION: These results revealed that AG improved neurogenesis, learning and 
      memory impairments, and oxidative imbalance in the brain juvenile Hypo rats.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether curcumin promotes hippocampal neurogenesis in 
      the cerebral ischemia (CI) mice via Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. METHODS: 
      Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into groups: sham operation group (Sham), 
      cerebral ischemic group (CI), curcumin treatment group (50, 100 mg/kg/d, i.p.) 
      and curcumin (100 mg/kg/d) + DKK1 (a blocker of Wnt receptor, 200 ng/d, icv) 
      group. CI was induced by bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion (BCCAO) for 
      20 min. The Morris water maze test was conducted to detect spatial learning and 
      memory. Immunofluorescence staining was used to examine the proliferation and 
      differentiation of immature neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. The 
      proteins involved in neurogenesis and Wnt signaling pathway were examined using 
      Western blot assay. RESULTS: Curcumin significantly alleviated cognitive deficits 
      induced by CI. Curcumin dose-dependently increased the proliferation of neural 
      stem cells and promoted the differentiation and maturation of newly generated 
      neural cells into neurons. Curcumin also increased the expression of proteins 
      involved in neurogenesis (including Ngn2, Pax6 and NeuroD 1) and the 
      Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, the forenamed effects of curcumin were 
      abolished by pretreatment with DKK1, a blocker of Wnt receptor. CONCLUSION: 
      Curcumin promotes hippocampal neurogenesis by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling 
      pathway to ameliorate cognitive deficits after acute CI.

TI  - Mitochondrial Proteins Unveil the Mechanism by Which Physical Exercise 
      Ameliorates Memory, Learning and Motor Activity in Hypoxic Ischemic 
      Encephalopathy Rat Model.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23084235 [doi]
LID - 4235
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical exercise has been shown to improve cognitive and motor 
      functions, promoting neurogenesis and demonstrating therapeutic benefits in 
      neurodegenerative disorders. Nonetheless, it is crucial to investigate the 
      cellular and molecular mechanisms by which this occurs. The study aimed to 
      investigate and evaluate the effect of swimming exercise on the changes of 
      mitochondrial proteins in the brains of rats with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy 
      (HIE). METHODS: the vertical pole and Morris water maze tests were used to assess 
      the animals' motor and cognitive functions, and western blot and 
      immunofluorescence of brain tissue were used to assess the biomarkers of 
      mitochondrial apoptosis and cristae stability in response to exercise training. 
      Four groups of rats were used: (1) sham sedentary group (SHAM, NT), (2) sham 
      exercise training group (SHAM, T) (3) hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy sedentary 
      group (HIE, NT), and (4) hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy exercise training group 
      (HIE, T). RESULTS: animals with HIE showed motor and cognitive deficits, as well 
      as increased apoptotic protein expression. Exercise, on the other hand, improved 
      motor and cognitive functions while also suppressing the expression of apoptotic 
      proteins. CONCLUSIONS: By stabilizing the mitochondrial cristae and suppressing 
      the apoptotic cascade, physical exercise provided neuroprotection in hypoxic 
      ischemia-induced brain injury.

TI  - Mineralocorticoid receptor agonist aldosterone rescues hippocampal neural stem 
      cell proliferation defects and improves postoperative cognitive function in aged 
      mice.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1080/15622975.2022.2082524 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Hippocampal neurogenesis is closely related to learning and memory, 
      and hippocampal neurogenesis disorders are involved in the development of many 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) plays a vital role in 
      regulating stress response, neuroendocrine and cognitive functions, and is 
      involved in regulating the integrity and stability of neural networks. However, 
      the potential role of MR in the pathogenesis of postoperative cognitive 
      dysfunction (POCD) is unclear. Therefore, this study evaluated the effect and 
      mechanism of MR activation on postoperative hippocampal neurogenesis and 
      cognitive function in aged mice.Methods: 18-month-old male Kunming mice were 
      randomly divided into Control group (C group), Surgery group (S group), Surgery+ 
      Aldosterone group (S+Aldo group), Surgery + Wortmannin group (S+Wort group), 
      Surgery + Aldosterone + Wortmannin group (S+Aldo+Wort group). Laparotomy was used 
      to establish an animal model of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. After 
      surgery, mice were intraperitoneally injected with aldosterone 
      (100 ug/kg,150 ug/kg,200 ug/kg) and / or wortmannin (1 mg/kg); One day before the 
      sacrifice, mice were injected intraperitoneally with BrdU (100 mg / kg / time, 3 
      times in total). Mice were subjected to Morris water maze and field tests at 1, 
      3, 7, and 14 days after surgery. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the number 
      of BrdU +, Nestin +, BrdU/Nestin + positive cells in the hippocampal dentate 
      gyrus of mice at 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after surgery. Western-blot was used to 
      detect PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway related proteins Akt, p-Akt, GSK-3β, 
      P-GSK-3β expression.Results: Stress impairs the performance of aged mice in water 
      maze and open field tests, reduces the number of BrdU/Nestin+ cells in the 
      hippocampal dentate gyrus, and inhibits the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β 
      proteins in the hippocampus. Aldosterone treatment promotes P-Akt, P-GSK-3β 
      protein expression and hippocampal neural stem cell proliferation, and improves 
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction. However, wortmannin treatment significantly 
      reversed these effects of aldosterone.Conclusions: The mineralocorticoid receptor 
      agonist aldosterone promotes the proliferation of hippocampal neural stem cells 
      and improves cognitive dysfunction in aged mice after surgery, and the mechanism 
      may be related to activation of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling.

AB  - The extract of Moringa oleifera seeds has been shown to possess various 
      pharmacological properties. In the present study, we assessed the 
      neuropharmacological effects of 70% ethanolic M. oleifera seed extract (MSE) on 
      cognitive impairment caused by scopolamine injection in mice using the passive 
      avoidance and Morris water maze (MWM) tests. MSE (250 or 500 mg/kg) was 
      administered to mice by oral gavage for 7 or 14 days, and cognitive impairment 
      was induced by intraperitoneal injection of scopolamine (4 mg/kg) for 1 or 6 
      days. Mice that received scopolamine alone showed impaired learning and memory 
      retention and considerably decreased cholinergic system reactivity and 
      neurogenesis in the hippocampus. MSE pretreatment significantly ameliorated 
      scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment and enhanced cholinergic system 
      reactivity and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Additionally, the protein 
      expressions of phosphorylated Akt, ERK1/2, and CREB in the hippocampus were 
      significantly decreased by scopolamine, but these decreases were reversed by MSE 
      treatment. These results suggest that MSE-induced ameliorative cognitive effects 
      are mediated by enhancement of the cholinergic neurotransmission system and 
      neurogenesis via activation of the Akt, ERK1/2, and CREB signaling pathways. 
      These findings suggest that MSE could be a potent neuropharmacological drug 
      against amnesia, and its mechanism might be modulation of cholinergic activity 
      via the Akt, ERK1/2, and CREB signaling pathways.

AB  - Life-time experiences are thought to influence the risk to develop the 
      neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, early-life 
      stress (ES) may modulate the onset and progression of AD. There is recent 
      evidence by our group and others that AD-related neuropathological progression 
      and the associated neuroimmune responses are modulated by ES in the classic 
      APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model for AD. We here extend our previous study on ES 
      mediated modulation of neuropathology and neuroinflammation and address in the 
      same cohort of mice whether ES accelerates and/or aggravates AD-induced cognitive 
      decline and alterations in the process of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), a 
      form of brain plasticity. Chronic ES was induced by limiting bedding and nesting 
      material during the first postnatal week and is known to induce cognitive 
      deficits by 4 months in wild type (WT) mice. The onset of cognitive decline in 
      APP/PS1 mice generally starts around 6 months of age. We here tested mice at ages 
      2-4 months to study acceleration and at ages 8-10 months for aggravation of the 
      APP/PS1 phenotype. ES-exposed WT and APP/PS1 mice were able to perform the object 
      recognition (ORT) and location tasks (OLT) at 2 months of age. Interestingly, at 
      3 months, ES induced impairments in the performance of the OLT in WT, but not in 
      APP/PS1 mice. APP/PS1 mice exhibited alterations in hippocampal cell 
      proliferation and differentiation, but ES exposure did not further change this. 
      At 9 months, APP/PS1 mice exhibited impaired performance in the Morris Water Maze 
      (MWM) task, as well as reductions in markers of the AHN process, which were not 
      further modulated by ES exposure. In addition, we observed a so far unreported 
      hyperactivity in ES-exposed mice at 8 months of age, which hampered assessment of 
      cognitive functions in the ORT and OLT. In conclusion, while ES has been reported 
      to modulate AD neuropathology and neuroinflammation before, it failed to 
      accelerate or aggravate the decline in cognition or the process of AHN in APP/PS1 
      mice at ages 2-4 and 8-10 months. Future studies are needed to unravel how ES 
      might affect the vulnerability to develop AD.

AB  - Pilocarpine-induced acute seizures strongly induce aberrant hippocampal 
      neurogenesis, characterized by increased proliferation of neural progenitors and 
      abnormal integrations of newly generated granule cells - hilar ectopic granule 
      cells (EGCs), mossy fibre sprouting (MFS), and hilar basal dendrites (HBDs), 
      which may disturb hippocampal neuronal circuits and thus contribute to cognitive 
      impairment in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients and animal models. Previous 
      studies via ablating hippocampal neurogenesis after acute seizures produced 
      inconsistent results regarding the development of long-term cognitive impairment. 
      Furthermore, a sufficient decrease of subsequent abnormal integrations in 
      chronically epileptic hippocampus was not well-established in these studies. 
      Therefore, the link between seizure-induced aberrant hippocampal neurogenesis and 
      cognitive decline associated with epilepsy is still in need to be clarified. In 
      this study, the mice were injected with methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) both 
      before and after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) to achieve an 
      overall ablation of newborn cells contributing to the pathological recruitment. 
      In addition, a protracted time point was chosen for behavioral testing 
      considering it takes a fairly long time for newborn granule cells to adequately 
      develop abnormal integrations, especially MFS. Although an overall reduction of 
      abnormal integrations, including EGCs, MFS and HBDs was confirmed following the 
      ablation regime, the performance of ablated and non-ablated mice in the Morris 
      Water Maze (MWM) task did not differ. The current findings therefore provide 
      novel evidences that ablation of neurogenesis with an overall decrease of 
      abnormal integrations cannot attenuate subsequent cognitive impairment at least 
      in the model used in this study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of maternal zinc deficiency on learning and 
      memory in offspring and the changes in DNA methylation patterns. METHODS: 
      Pregnant rats were divided into zinc adequate (ZA), zinc deficient (ZD), and 
      paired fed (PF) groups. Serum zinc contents and AKP activity in mother rats and 
      offspring at P21 (end of lactation) and P60 (weaned, adult) were detected. 
      Cognitive ability of offspring at P21 and P60 were determined by Morris water 
      maze. The expression of proteins including DNMT3a, DNMT1, GADD45β, MeCP2 and BDNF 
      in the offspring hippocampus were detected by Western-blot. The methylation 
      status of BDNF promoter region in hippocampus of offspring rats was detected by 
      MS-qPCR. RESULTS: Compared with the ZA and PF groups, pups in the ZD group had 
      lower zinc levels and AKP activity in the serum, spent more time finding the 
      platform and spent less time going through the platform area. Protein expression 
      of DNMT1 and GADD45b were downregulated in the ZD group during P0 and P21 but not 
      P60 compared with the ZA and PF group, these results were consistent with a 
      reduction in BDNF protein at P0 (neonate), P21. However, when pups of rats in the 
      ZD group were supplemented with zinc ion from P21 to P60, MeCP2 and GADD45b 
      expression were significantly downregulated compared with the ZA and PF group. 
      CONCLUSION: Post-weaning zinc supplementation may improve cognitive impairment 
      induced by early life zinc deficiency, whereas it may not completely reverse the 
      abnormal expression of particular genes that are involved in DNA methylation, 
      binding to methylated DNA and neurogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The persistence of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is sharply 
      decreased in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The neuropathologies of AD include the 
      presence of amyloid-β deposition in plaques, tau hyperphosphorylation in 
      neurofibrillary tangles, and cholinergic system degeneration. The focused 
      ultrasound (FUS)-mediated blood-brain barrier opening modulates tau 
      hyperphosphorylation, the accumulation of amyloid-β proteins, and increases in 
      AHN. However, it remains unclear whether FUS can modulate AHN in 
      cholinergic-deficient conditions. In this study, we investigated the effect of 
      FUS on AHN in a cholinergic degeneration rat model of dementia. METHODS: Adult 
      male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 48; 200-250 g) were divided into control 
      (phosphate-buffered saline injection), 192 IgG-saporin (SAP), and SAP+FUS groups; 
      in the two latter groups, SAP was injected bilaterally into the lateral 
      ventricle. We applied FUS to the bilateral hippocampus with microbubbles. 
      Immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblotting, 
      5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling, an acetylcholinesterase assay, and the Morris 
      water maze test were performed to assess choline acetyltransferase, 
      acetylcholinesterase activity, brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression, 
      neural proliferation, and spatial memory, respectively. Statistical significance 
      of differences in between groups was calculated using one-way and two-way 
      analyses of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test to determine 
      the individual and interactive effects of FUS on immunochemistry and behavioral 
      analysis. P < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Cholinergic degeneration 
      in rats significantly decreased the number of choline acetyltransferase neurons 
      (P < 0.05) in the basal forebrain, as well as AHN and spatial memory function. 
      Rats that underwent FUS-mediated brain-blood barrier opening exhibited 
      significant increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; P < 0.05), 
      early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) (P < 0.01), AHN (P < 0.01), and 
      acetylcholinesterase activity in the frontal cortex (P < 0.05) and hippocampus 
      (P < 0.01) and crossing over (P < 0.01) the platform in the Morris water maze 
      relative to the SAP group after sonication. CONCLUSIONS: FUS treatment increased 
      AHN and improved spatial memory. This improvement was mediated by increased 
      hippocampal BDNF and EGR1. FUS treatment may also restore AHN and protect against 
      neurodegeneration, providing a potentially powerful therapeutic strategy for AD.

AB  - Tinnitus is thought to be caused by damage to the auditory and nonauditory system 
      due to exposure to loud noise, aging, or other etiologies. However, at present, 
      the exact neurophysiological basis of chronic tinnitus remains unknown. To 
      explore whether the function of the limbic system is disturbed in tinnitus, the 
      hippocampus was selected, which plays a vital role in learning and memory. The 
      hippocampal function was examined with a learning and memory procedure. For this 
      purpose, sodium salicylate (NaSal) was used to create a rat animal model of 
      tinnitus, evaluated with prepulse inhibition behavior (PPI). The acquisition and 
      retrieval abilities of spatial memory were measured using the Morris water maze 
      (MWM) in NaSal-treated and control animals, followed by observation of c-Fos and 
      delta-FosB protein expression in the hippocampal field by immunohistochemistry. 
      To further identify the neural substrate for memory change in tinnitus, 
      neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG) was compared 
      between the NaSal group and the control group. The results showed that 
      acquisition and retrieval of spatial memory were impaired by NaSal treatment. The 
      expression of c-Fos and delta-FosB protein was also inhibited in NaSal-treated 
      animals. Simultaneously, neurogenesis in the DG was also impaired in tinnitus 
      animals. In general, our data suggest that the hippocampal system (limbic system) 
      may play a key role in tinnitus pathology.

TI  - 3,4,5-Tricaffeoylquinic acid induces adult neurogenesis and improves deficit of 
      learning and memory in aging model senescence-accelerated prone 8 mice.
PG  - 401-422
LID - 10.18632/aging.101748 [doi]
AB  - Caffeoylquinic acid (CQA) is a natural polyphenol with evidence of antioxidant 
      and neuroprotective effects and prevention of deficits in spatial learning and 
      memory. We studied the cognitive-enhancing effect of 3,4,5-tricaffeoylquinic acid 
      (TCQA) and explored its cellular and molecular mechanism in the 
      senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) model of aging and Alzheimer's 
      disease as well as in human neural stem cells (hNSCs). Mice were fed with 5 mg/kg 
      of TCQA for 30 days and were tested in the Morris water maze (MWM). Brain tissues 
      were collected for immunohistochemical detection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to 
      detect activated stem cells and newborn neurons. TCQA-treated SAMP8 exhibited 
      significantly improved cognitive performance in MWM compared to water-treated 
      SAMP8. TCQA-treated SAMP8 mice also had significantly higher numbers of 
      BrdU+/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP+) and BrdU+/Neuronal nuclei (NeuN+) 
      cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) neurogenic niche compared with untreated SAMP8. 
      In hNSCs, TCQA induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1, actin cytoskeleton 
      organization, chromatin remodeling, neuronal differentiation, and bone 
      morphogenetic protein signaling. The neurogenesis promoting effect of TCQA in the 
      DG of SAMP8 mice might explain the cognition-enhancing influence of TCQA observed 
      in our study, and our hNSCs in aggregate suggest a therapeutic potential for TCQA 
      in aging-associated diseases.

AB  - Searching for the new and effective anticonvulsants in our previous study we 
      developed a new hybrid compound C-11 derived from 2-(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl) 
      propanamide. C11 revealed high efficacy in acute animal seizure models such as 
      the maximal electroshock model (MES), the pentylenetetrazole model (PTZ) and the 
      6 Hz (6 Hz, 32 mA) seizure model, as well as in the kindling model of epilepsy 
      induced by repeated injection of PTZ in mice. In the aim of further in vivo C11 
      characterization, in the current studies we evaluated its influence on cognitive 
      functions, neurodegeneration and neurogenesis process in mice after chronical 
      treatment. All experiments were performed on 6 weeks old male C57/BL mice. The 
      following drugs were used: C11, levetiracetam (LEV), ethosuximide (ETS) and 
      lacosamide (LCM). We analyzed proliferation, migration and differentiation of 
      newborn cells as well as neurodegenerative changes in a mouse brain after 
      long-term treatment with aforementioned AEDs. Additionally, we evaluated changes 
      in learning and memory functions in response to chronic C11, LEV, LCM and ETS 
      treatment. C11 as well as LEV and ETS did not disturb the proliferation of 
      newborn cells compared to the control mice, whereas LCM treatment significantly 
      decreased it. Chronic AEDs therapy did not induce significant neurodegenerative 
      changes. Behavioral studies with using Morris Water Maze test did not indicate 
      any disturbances in the spatial learning and memory after C11 as well as LEV and 
      ETS treatment in comparison to the control group except LCM mice where 
      significant dysfunctions in time, distance and direct swim to the platform were 
      observed. Interestingly, results obtained from in vivo MRI spectroscopy showed a 
      statistically significant increase of one of the neurometabolites- 
      N-acetyloaspartate (NAA) for LCM and LEV mice. A new hybrid compound C11 in 
      contrast to LCM has no negative impact on the process of neurogenesis and 
      neurodegeneration in the mouse hippocampus. Furthermore, chronic treatment with 
      C11 turned out to have no negative impact on cognitive functions of treated mice, 
      which, is certainly of great importance for further more advanced preclinical and 
      especially clinical trials.

      brain injury (TBI) both in humans and in mice. Although there is a close 
      relationship between CD24 and neurogenesis, it remains unknown about the specific 
      role of CD24 in neurogenesis areas after TBI. Here, the expression of CD24 was 
      detected in the ipsilateral hippocampus by the Western blotting and real-time 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RNA interference was applied to 
      investigate the effects of CD24 on post-traumatic neurogenesis. Brain sections 
      were labeled with CD24 and doublecortin (DCX) via immunofluorescence. The Morris 
      water maze test was used to assess cognitive functions. The results indicated 
      that both mRNA and protein levels of CD24 were markedly elevated in the 
      hippocampus after TBI. Meanwhile, TBI could cause a decrease of DCX-positive 
      cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Downregulation of CD24 
      significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of Src homology region 2-containing 
      protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 in the ipsilateral hippocampus. Meanwhile, 
      inhibition of CD24 could reduce the number of DCX-positive cells in the dentate 
      gyrus area and impair cognitive functions of the TBI mice. These data suggested 
      that hippocampal expression of CD24 might positively regulate neurogenesis and 
      improve cognitive functions after TBI.

AB  - Abstinence after alcohol dependence leads to structural and functional recovery 
      in many regions of the brain, especially the hippocampus. Significant increases 
      in neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and subsequent "reactive neurogenesis" 
      coincides with structural recovery in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). However, 
      whether these reactively born neurons are integrated appropriately into neural 
      circuits remains unknown. Therefore, adult male rats were exposed to a binge 
      model of alcohol dependence. On day 7 of abstinence, the peak of reactive NSC 
      proliferation, rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to label dividing 
      cells. After six weeks, rats underwent Morris Water Maze (MWM) training then were 
      sacrificed ninety minutes after the final training session. Using fluorescent 
      immunohistochemistry for c-Fos (neuronal activation), BrdU, and Neuronal Nuclei 
      (NeuN), we investigated whether neurons born during reactive neurogenesis were 
      incorporated into a newly learned MWM neuronal ensemble. Prior alcohol exposure 
      increased the number of BrdU+ cells and newborn neurons (BrdU+/NeuN+ cells) in 
      the DG versus controls. However, prior ethanol exposure had no significant impact 
      on MWM-induced c-Fos expression. Despite increased BrdU+ neurons, no difference 
      in the number of activated newborn neurons (BrdU+/c-Fos+/NeuN+) was observed. 
      These data suggest that neurons born during alcohol-induced reactive neurogenesis 
      are functionally integrated into hippocampal circuitry.

AB  - Background: Adult neurogenesis plays an important role in repairing damaged 
      neurons and improving cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). B. 
      Papyrifera (L.) L'Hér. ex Vent. fruits (BL), a traditional Chinese medicine for 
      tonifying the kidney, has been reported to improve cognitive function in AD mice, 
      but the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly illuminated. This study aimed 
      to provide an overview of the differential compounds in the brain of APP/PS1 mice 
      after BL water extract (BLWE) treatment through metabolomics technology and to 
      elucidate whether the therapeutic effect and mechanism are through the 
      enhancement of neurogenesis. Methods: APP/PS1 transgenic mice were treated with 
      different doses of BLWE. After 6 weeks of intragastric injection, the therapeutic 
      effects of BLWE on APP/PS1 transgenic mice were determined by the Morris water 
      maze test, immunohistochemistry, hematoxylin & eosin and Nissl staining, 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP 
      nick end labeling staining. Subsequently, metabolomics technology was used to 
      analyze the regulatory effect of BLWE on differential compounds in the brain of 
      APP/PS1 mice, and on this basis, its molecular mechanism of BLWE was screened. 
      Finally, the protein expression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was 
      detected by Western blotting. Results: After BLWE treatment, the learning and 
      memory function of APP/PS1 mice were significantly improved, which was related to 
      the increase in the number of Nestin(+)/BrdU(+) and NeuN(+)/BrdU(+) cells, and 
      the decrease in the number of apoptotic cells in the hippocampus. BLWE treatment 
      could also up-regulate the expression of synapse-associated proteins. Moreover, 
      BLWE could modulate endogenous metabolic compounds in the brains of AD mice, 
      including N-acetyl-aspartate, glutamine, etc. Furthermore, BLWE inhibited the 
      phosphorylation of Tyr216-GSK-3β and β-catenin protein while increased CyclinD(1) 
      protein expression. Conclusion: We demonstrated that BLWE can enhance neural stem 
      cells proliferation and improve neurogenesis, thereby efficiently repairing 
      damaged neurons in the hippocampus and ameliorating cognitive impairment in 
      APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The mechanism is at least partly through activating the 
      Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

      promoting angiogenesis in experimental mice.

AB  - As a highly evolutionary conserved lncRNA, MALAT1 was first demonstrated to 
      associate with metastasis of lung tumor by promoting angiogenesis. Activated 
      vasculature was recently indicated to assist neurogenesis by secreting 
      neurotrophic factor Ang1 (Angiopoietin-1). The purpose of this study is to 
      investigate the potential role of MALAT1 in angiogenesis following traumatic 
      brain injury (TBI). Adult male mice were subjected to controlled cortical impact 
      (CCI) and brain microvascular endothelial cells were exposed to oxygen-glucose 
      deprivation (OGD). MALAT1 RNA levels were quantified by qRT-PCR in different 
      cells of CNS and located by RNA-FISH. Angiogenesis were measured by cell 
      viability, migration assay, tube formation assay in vitro, and 
      immunohistochemistry in vivo. Expression of Angiopoietin-1 was assessed by 
      Western blot. Neurological functions were performed by NSS, Wire grip and MWM 
      tests. Our results indicated that 1) MALAT1 RNA was localized in cerebral 
      endothelium, enhanced by OGD stimuli. 2) Inhibition of MALAT1 by siRNA suppressed 
      angiogenesis, as indicated by endothelial viability, tube formation, migration, 
      and functional vessel density. 3) MALAT1 inhibition further decreased Ang1 
      expression in the endothelium. 4) Mice with MALAT1 inhibition exhibited worse 
      behavioral performances (NSS, wire grip, Morris water maze), as compared to 
      control. MALAT1 could promote angiogenesis, subsequently contributing to the Ang1 
      synthesis from active vasculature. It may eventually benefit to functional 
      recovery following TBI.

AB  - Goal-directed navigation requires learning strategies that are efficient and 
      minimize costs. In some cases it may be desirable to flexibly adjust behavioral 
      responses depending on the cues that vary from one episode to the next. In 
      others, successful navigation might be achieved with inflexible, habit-like 
      responses that reduce cognitive load. Adult neurogenesis is believed to 
      contribute to the spatial processing functions of the hippocampus, particularly 
      when behavioral flexibility is required. However, little is known about the role 
      of neurogenesis in spatial navigation when goals are unpredictable or change 
      repeatedly according to certain rules. We hypothesized that neurogenesis is 
      necessary in a spatial navigation task that involves different patterns of 
      reinforcement. Intact and neurogenesis-deficient rats were trained to escape to 
      one of two possible platform locations in a spatial water maze. The platform 
      either repeated in the same location for all trials in a day, alternated between 
      two locations across trials, or randomly moved between the two locations. 
      Neurogenesis selectively enhanced escape performance in the alternating 
      condition, but not by improving platform choice accuracy. Instead, 
      neurogenesis-intact rats made fewer search errors and developed an efficient 
      habit-like strategy where they consistently swam to a preferred location. If the 
      platform was not present, they proceeded to the other possible location. In 
      contrast, neurogenesis-deficient rats were indecisive and navigationally 
      less-efficient. Thus, in conditions where goals follow a predictable 
      spatiotemporal pattern, adult neurogenesis promotes the adoption of navigation 
      strategies that are spatially nonspecific but, nonetheless, accurate and 
      efficient.

TI  - Neonatal Supplementation of Oleamide During Suckling Promotes Learning Ability 
      and Memory in Adolescent Mice.
PG  - 889-898
LID - 10.1093/jn/nxab442 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatty acid amides (FAMs) are present in breast milk. Oleamide (ODA), 
      a member of the FAM family, has been reported to affect learning and 
      memory-related abilities in animal experiments. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to 
      characterize the temporal changes of FAMs in human milk and sought to examine the 
      effect of ODA supplementation during suckling on postweaning cognitive 
      performance in mice. METHODS: FAMs were measured in human milk (postpartum 1-24 
      wk) by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadruple mass spectrometry 
      (UPLC-TQ-MS) analysis. We supplemented neonatal C57BL/6J mice of both sexes with 
      vehicle (control), 5 mg/(kg · day) ODA (L-ODA), or 25 mg/(kg · day) ODA (H-ODA) 
      throughout suckling by oral gavage. After weaning, the Morris water maze test and 
      novel object recognition test were performed. Neurogenesis, spinal morphogenesis 
      in the dentate gyrus (DG) region, and hippocampal expression of synaptic markers 
      were analyzed. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: 
      ODA (0.566-1.31 mg/L) was the most abundant FAM in breast milk, followed by 
      palmitamide (0.135-0.269 mg/L) and linoleamide (0.046-0.242 mg/L). Compared with 
      the control group, the H-ODA group demonstrated shorter escape latency, shorter 
      travel distance, 113% more platform crossing, and 48% greater discrimination 
      index in behavioral tests (P < 0.05). Additionally, the H-ODA group showed a 
      higher density of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU)+ and EdU+& doublecortin (DCX)+ 
      cells (62% and 53%, respectively), and 52% greater spine density in the DG region 
      than the control group (P < 0.05). The synaptic markers, postsynaptic density 
      protein 95 (PSD95) and synaptophysin (SYP), were upregulated in the H-ODA group 
      compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The L-ODA group also showed shorter 
      escape latency in behavioral tests and 27% greater spine density in the DG region 
      than the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ODA is the most common FAM in 
      human milk. ODA supplementation during suckling promotes learning and 
      memory-related abilities in adolescent mice by augmenting hippocampal neuronal 
      proliferation and boosting synaptic plasticity.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vascular dementia (VaD) is a complex neurodegenerative 
      disease affecting cognition and memory. There is a lack of approved 
      pharmacological treatments specifically for VaD. In this study, we investigate 
      the therapeutic effects of AV-001, a Tie2 receptor agonist, in middle-aged rats 
      subjected to a multiple microinfarct (MMI) model of VaD. METHODS: Male, 10-12 
      month-old, Wistar rats were employed. The following experimental groups were 
      used: Sham, MMI, MMI+1 μg/Kg AV-001, MMI+3 μg/Kg AV-001, MMI+6 μg/Kg AV-001. 
      AV-001 treatment was initiated at 1 day after MMI and administered once daily via 
      intraperitoneal injection. An investigator blinded to the experimental groups 
      conducted a battery of neuro-cognitive tests including modified neurological 
      severity score (mNSS) test, novel object recognition test, novel odor recognition 
      test, three chamber social interaction test, and Morris water maze test. Rats 
      were sacrificed at 6 weeks after MMI. RESULTS: There was no mortality observed 
      after 1, 3, or 6 μg/Kg AV-001 treatment in middle-aged rats subjected to MMI. 
      AV-001 treatment (1, 3, or 6 μg/Kg) does not significantly alter blood pressure 
      or heart rate at 6 weeks after MMI compared to baseline values or the MMI control 
      group. Treatment of MMI with 1 or 3 μg/Kg AV-001 treatment does not significantly 
      alter body weight compared to Sham or MMI control group. While 6 μg/Kg AV-001 
      treated group exhibit significantly lower body weight compared to Sham and MMI 
      control group, the weight loss is evident starting at 1 day after MMI when 
      treatment was initiated and is not significantly different compared to its 
      baseline values at day 0 or day 1 after MMI. AV-001 treatment significantly 
      decreases serum alanine aminotransferase, serum creatinine, and serum troponin I 
      levels compared to the MMI control group; however, all values are within normal 
      range. MMI induces mild neurological deficits in middle-aged rats indicated by 
      low mNSS scores (<6 on a scale of 0-18). Compared to control MMI group, 1 μg/Kg 
      AV-001 treatment group did not exhibit significantly different mNSS scores, while 
      3 and 6 μg/Kg AV-001 treatment induced significantly worse mNSS scores on days 
      21-42 and 14-42 after MMI, respectively. MMI in middle-aged rats induces 
      significant cognitive impairment including short-term memory loss, long-term 
      memory loss, reduced preference for social novelty and impaired spatial learning 
      and memory compared to sham control rats. Rats treated with 1 μg/Kg AV-001 
      exhibit significantly improved short-term and long-term memory, increased 
      preference for social novelty, and improved spatial learning and memory compared 
      to MMI rats. Treatment with 3 μg/Kg AV-001 improves short-term memory and 
      preference for social novelty but does not improve long-term memory or spatial 
      learning and memory compared to MMI rats. Treatment with 6 μg/Kg AV-001 improves 
      only long-term memory compared to MMI rats. Thus, 1 μg/Kg AV-001 treatment was 
      selected as an optimal dose. Treatment of middle-aged rats subjected to MMI with 
      1 μg/Kg AV-001 significantly increases axon density, myelin density and myelin 
      thickness in the corpus callosum, as well as increases synaptic protein 
      expression, neuronal branching and dendritic spine density in the cortex, 
      oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell number in the cortex and 
      striatum and promotes neurogenesis in the subventricular zone compared to control 
      MMI rats. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we present AV-001 as a novel therapeutic 
      agent to improve cognitive function and reduce white matter injury in middle 
      aged-rats subjected to a MMI model of VaD. Treatment of MMI with 1 μg/Kg AV-001 
      significantly improves cognitive function, and increases axon density, 
      remyelination and neuroplasticity in the brain of middle-aged rats.

AB  - Memory impairment by the Amyloid-β 25-35 (Aβ(25-35)) peptide in animal models has 
      provided an understanding of the causes behind the similar deterioration that 
      occurs in Alzheimer's disease. However, it is uncertain if a decrease of 
      dendritic spines and neurogenesis conduces to cognitive impairment by an 
      impairment in the retrieval of stored memory. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate the consequences of impairment on spatial memory caused by the 
      administration of the Aβ(25-35) peptide in the hippocampus, which is associated 
      whit morphological changes and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). The 
      vehicle or Aβ(25-35) peptide (0.1μg/μL) were bilaterally administered in the CA1 
      subfield of the rat hippocampus. The animals were tested for spatial learning and 
      memory in the Morris Water Maze. In the day's 11, 18 and 32 after administration 
      of the Aβ(25-35) peptide were examined the morphological changes in the DG using 
      a Golgi-Cox stain. In the day 32, the neurogenesis was evaluated by the 
      immunoreactivity to 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 100mg/kg, i.p.) that 
      corresponding to cellular proliferation post damage, the neuronal specific 
      nuclear protein (NeuN) and doublecortin (DCX). This study found a memory 
      retrieval impairment occurring at day 17, a cognitive deficit which had increased 
      significantly at day 31 after the administration of Aβ(25-35) peptide. These 
      results are related to morphological changes in the granular cells of the DG, 
      such as a shorter dendritic length and a decrease in the number of dendritic 
      spines. In neurogenesis, the total number of cells positive to BrdU, NeuN and DCX 
      in the hippocampal granule cell layer was found to have declined in animals 
      treated with Aβ(25-35). The results suggest that the Aβ(25-35) peptide impairs 
      memory retrieval by decreasing the number of dendritic spines and altering 
      neurogenesis in the DG.

PG  - 2607-2627
LID - 10.18632/aging.203958 [doi]
AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global health issue that affects at least 10 
      million people per year. Neuronal cell death and brain injury after TBI, 
      including apoptosis, inflammation, and excitotoxicity, have led to detrimental 
      effects in TBI. 2, 3, 5, 4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (THSG), a 
      water-soluble compound extracted from the Chinese herb Polygonum multiflorum, has 
      been shown to exert various biological functions. However, the effects of THSG on 
      TBI is still poorly understood. THSG reduced L-glutamate-induced DNA 
      fragmentation and protected glial and neuronal cell death after L-glutamate 
      stimulation. Our results also showed that TBI caused significant behavioral 
      deficits in the performance of beam walking, mNSS, and Morris water maze tasks in 
      a mouse model. Importantly, daily administration of THSG (60 mg/kg/day) after TBI 
      for 21 days attenuated the injury severity score, promoted motor coordination, 
      and improved cognitive performance post-TBI. Moreover, administration of THSG 
      also dramatically decreased the brain lesion volume. THSG reduced TBI-induced 
      neuronal apoptosis in the brain cortex 24 h after TBI. Furthermore, THSG 
      increased the number of immature neurons in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the 
      dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that THSG exerts 
      neuroprotective effects on glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and glial and 
      neuronal cell death. The present study also demonstrated that THSG effectively 
      protects against TBI-associated motor and cognitive impairment, at least in part, 
      by inhibiting TBI-induced apoptosis and promoting neurogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of Alzheimer's disease (AD) models obtained by intracerebral 
      infusion of amyloid-β (Aβ) has been increasingly reported in recent years. 
      Nonetheless, these models may present important challenges. OBJECTIVE: We have 
      focused on canonical mechanisms of hippocampal-related neural plasticity to 
      characterize a rat model obtained by an intracerebroventricular (icv) injection 
      of soluble amyloid-β42 (Aβ42). METHODS: Animal behavior was evaluated in the 
      elevated plus maze, Y-Maze spontaneous or forced alternation, Morris water maze, 
      and open field, starting 2 weeks post-Aβ42 infusion. Hippocampal neurogenesis was 
      assessed 3 weeks after Aβ42 injection. Aβ deposition, tropomyosin receptor kinase 
      B levels, and neuroinflammation were appraised at 3 and 14 days post-Aβ42 
      administration. RESULTS: We found that immature neuronal dendritic morphology was 
      abnormally enhanced, but proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the 
      dentate gyrus was conserved one month after Aβ42 injection. Surprisingly, animal 
      behavior did not reveal changes in cognitive performance nor in locomotor and 
      anxious-related activity. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor related-signaling was 
      also unchanged at 3 and 14 days post-Aβ icv injection. Likewise, astrocytic and 
      microglial markers of neuroinflammation in the hippocampus were unaltered in 
      these time points. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data emphasize a high 
      variability and lack of behavioral reproducibility associated with these Aβ 
      injection-based models, as well as the need for its further optimization, aiming 
      at addressing the gap between preclinical AD models and the human disorder.

      by rescuing neuronal death and triggering endogenous neurogenesis in AD-like mice 
      induced by a combination of Aβ42 and scopolamine.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: According to the theory of traditional Chinese 
      medicine (TCM), Alzheimer's disease (AD) is identified as "forgetfulness" or 
      "dementia", and is mainly caused by "kidney essence deficiency" which ultimately 
      induces "encephala reduction". Therefore, herbal formulas possessing the efficacy 
      of nourishing kidney essence or replenishing brain marrow are commonly served as 
      effective strategies for AD treatment. Shenzao jiannao oral liquid (SZJN), a 
      traditional Chinese preparation approved by the China Food and Drug 
      Administration (CFDA), is used for the treatment of insomnia and mind fatigue at 
      present for its efficacy of nourishing kidneys. In present study, we found that 
      SZJN could improve cognitive function of AD-like mice. AIMS OF STUDY: This study 
      aims to investigate the effects of SJZN on ameliorating cognitive deficits of 
      AD-like mouse model, and to illuminate the underlying mechanisms from the 
      perspective of neuroprotection and neurogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Kunming 
      mice (28 ± 2 g) were randomly allocated into seven groups: control, sham, model, 
      donepezil and SZJN groups (low, middle and high). The AD mouse model was 
      established by Aβ42 combined with scopolamine. SZJN were intragastrically 
      administrated at doses of 0.3, 1.5 and 7.5 g/kg for 28 days. Morris water maze 
      (MWM) test was applied to determine the cognitive function. Hematoxylin eosin 
      (HE) and Nissl staining were carried out to evaluate pathological damages in the 
      cortex and hippocampal tissues. To explore the protective effects of SZJN on 
      multiple pathogenic factors of AD, protein levels of Aβ42, glial fibrillary 
      acidic protein (GFAP), Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, synaptophysin (SYP), brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurogenesis related proteins were assessed using 
      Immunofluorescence (IF) and western blot analysis. In vitro, the AD cell model 
      was established by transduction of APP(695swe) genes into Neural stem cells 
      (NSCs) isolated from the hippocampal tissues of neonatal C57BL/6 mice. Cell 
      viability assay and neurosphere formation assay were carried out to verify the 
      efficacy of SZJN on proliferation of NSCs. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that 
      SZJN (1.5 g/kg and 7.5 g/kg) treatment significantly ameliorated cognitive 
      deficits of AD-like mice. SZJN (7.5 g/kg) treatment significantly retarded the 
      pathological damages including neuronal degeneration, neuronal apoptosis, Aβ 
      peptides aggregation and reaction of astrocytes in AD-like mice. In addition, 
      SZJN (7.5 g/kg) increased the expression of BDNF and SYP, and restored the 
      abnormal level of MDA and SOD in the brain of AD-like mice. Furthermore, SZJN 
      treatment for 28 days remarkably increased the proliferation of NSCs evidenced by 
      more Nestin(+) and BrdU(+) cells in the hippocampal DG regions, and increased the 
      amount of mature neurons marked by NeuN both in the cortex and hippocampal DG 
      regions. In vitro, SZJN treatement (16, 32, 64 mg/ml) promoted the proliferation 
      of NSCs evidenced by the increased amount and enlarged size of the neurospheres 
      (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that SZJN could ameliorate 
      cognitive deficits by protecting neurons from death and triggering endogenous 
      neurogenesis. Therefore, SZJN may be considered as a promising agent to restore 
      neuronal loss and deter the deterioration in AD patients.

TI  - Expression of NLRP3 Inflammasomes in Neurogenic Niche Contributes to the Effect 
      of Spatial Learning in Physiological Conditions but Not in Alzheimer's Type 
      Neurodegeneration.
PG  - 1355-1371
LID - 10.1007/s10571-020-01021-y [doi]
AB  - A common feature of neurodegenerative disorders, in particular Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD), is a chronic neuroinflammation associated with aberrant 
      neuroplasticity. Development of neuroinflammation affects efficacy of stem and 
      progenitor cells proliferation, differentiation, migration, and integration of 
      newborn cells into neural circuitry. However, precise mechanisms of neurogenesis 
      alterations in neuroinflammation are not clear yet. It is well established that 
      expression of NLRP3 inflammasomes in glial cells marks neuroinflammatory events, 
      but less is known about contribution of NLRP3 to deregulation of neurogenesis 
      within neurogenic niches and whether neural stem cells (NSCs), neural progenitor 
      cells (NPCs) or immature neuroblasts may express inflammasomes in 
      (patho)physiological conditions. Thus, we studied alterations of neurogenesis in 
      rats with the AD model (intra-hippocampal injection of Aβ1-42). We found that in 
      Aβ-affected brain, number of CD133+ cells was elevated after spatial training in 
      the Morris water maze. The number of PSA-NCAM+ neuroblasts diminished by Aβ 
      injection was completely restored by subsequent spatial learning. Spatial 
      training leads to elevated expression of NLRP3 inflammasomes in the SGZ 
      (subgranular zones): CD133+ and PSA-NCAM+ cells started to express NLRP3 in 
      sham-operated, but not AD rats. Taken together, our data suggest that expression 
      of NLRP3 inflammasomes in CD133+ and PSA-NCAM+ cells may contribute to 
      stimulation of adult neurogenesis in physiological conditions, whereas 
      Alzheimer's type neurodegeneration abolishes stimuli-induced overexpression of 
      NLRP3 within the SGZ neurogenic niche.

TI  - A Novel 2-Phenylamino-Quinazoline-Based Compound Expands the Neural Stem Cell 
      Pool and Promotes the Hippocampal Neurogenesis and the Cognitive Ability of Adult 
      Mice.

AB  - The adult neurogenesis occurs throughout the life of the mammalian hippocampus 
      and is found to be essential for learning and memory. Identifying new ways to 
      manipulate the number of neural stem cells (NSCs) and enhance endogenous 
      neurogenesis in adults is very important. Here we found that a novel compound, 
      N2-(4-isopropylphenyl)-5-(3-methoxyphenoxy)quinazoline-2,4-diamine (code-named 
      Yhhu-3792), enhanced the self-renewal capability of NSCs in vitro and in vivo. In 
      vitro, Yhhu-3792 increased the ratio of 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine(+) 
      /4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole(+) embryonic NSCs and accelerated the growth of 
      neurospheres significantly. We demonstrated that Yhhu-3792 activated Notch 
      signaling pathway and promoted the expression of Notch target genes, Hes3 and 
      Hes5. And the Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT could inhibit its function. Thus, we 
      concluded Yhhu-3792 increased the number of embryonic NSCs via activating the 
      Notch signaling pathway. We measured the effect of Yhhu-3792 on epidermal growth 
      factor receptor signaling, which demonstrated Yhhu-3792 act via a different 
      mechanism with the quinazoline parent chemical group. In the eight-week-old male 
      C57BL/6 mice, chronic Yhhu-3792 administration expanded the NSCs pool and 
      promoted endogenous neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). It also 
      increased the spatial and episodic memory abilities of mice, when evaluated with 
      the Morris water maze and Fear conditioning tests. In conclusion, Yhhu-3792 could 
      be a novel drug candidate to promote the self-renew of NSCs and adult 
      neurogenesis. And it may have therapeutic potential in the impairment of learning 
      and memory associated DG dysfunction. Stem Cells 2018;36:1273-1285.

TI  - Recovery of Hippocampal-Dependent Learning Despite Blunting Reactive Adult 
      Neurogenesis After Alcohol Dependence.
PG  - 83-101
LID - 10.3233/BPL-200108 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The excessive alcohol drinking that occurs in alcohol use disorder 
      (AUD) causes neurodegeneration in regions such as the hippocampus, though 
      recovery may occur after a period of abstinence. Mechanisms of recovery are not 
      clear, though reactive neurogenesis has been observed in the hippocampal dentate 
      gyrus following alcohol dependence and correlates to recovery of granule cell 
      number. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of neurons born during reactive 
      neurogenesis in the recovery of hippocampal learning behavior after 4-day binge 
      alcohol exposure, a model of an AUD. We hypothesized that reducing reactive 
      neurogenesis would impair functional recovery. METHODS: Adult male rats were 
      subjected to 4-day binge alcohol exposure and two approaches were tested to blunt 
      reactive adult neurogenesis, acute doses of alcohol or the chemotherapy drug, 
      temozolomide (TMZ). RESULTS: Acute 5 g/kg doses of EtOH gavaged T6 and T7 days 
      post binge did not inhibit significantly the number of Bromodeoxyuridine-positive 
      (BrdU+) proliferating cells in EtOH animals receiving 5 g/kg EtOH versus 
      controls. A single cycle of TMZ inhibited reactive proliferation (BrdU+ cells) 
      and neurogenesis (NeuroD+ cells) to that of controls. However, despite this 
      blunting of reactive neurogenesis to basal levels, EtOH-TMZ rats were not 
      impaired in their recovery of acquisition of the Morris water maze (MWM), 
      learning similarly to all other groups 35 days after 4-day binge exposure. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that TMZ is effective in decreasing reactive 
      proliferation/neurogenesis following 4-day binge EtOH exposure, and baseline 
      levels of adult neurogenesis are sufficient to allow recovery of hippocampal 
      function.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of tofisopam, a 
      2,3-benzodiazepine derivative anxiolytic, on cognitive deficits in rats with 
      scopolamine-induced amnesia. Cognitive performance of the rats was investigated 
      by using the Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests. Changes in motor 
      activity were assessed by using the activity cage and Rota-rod tests and then 
      morphological changes in the hippocampus were assessed via immunohistochemical 
      stainings. The results indicated that scopolamine impaired learning and memory 
      parameters in rats. Worsened cognitive performance, neuronal loss, and decreased 
      hippocampal synaptophysin, Ki-67, and glial fibrillary acidic protein density 
      were observed. Tofisopam administration at a dose of 50 mg/kg for seven days 
      improved the impaired cognitive performance, enhanced the attenuated synaptic 
      transmission in the hippocampus, increased proliferation in subgranular zones, 
      and improved the decrease in astrocytes in amnesic rats. These findings point out 
      the anti-amnesic effects of tofisopam with concomitant improvements in the 
      hippocampal synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, and glial plasticity, for the first 
      time. Presented beneficial effects of tofisopam on cognitive dysfunctions may 
      have a notable clinical value considering the fact that one of the most important 
      side effects of 1,4-benzodiazepines, which are classical anxiolytic drugs, is 
      amnesia. However, these preclinical results need to be confirmed with further 
      clinical studies, first.

AB  - Neuronal apoptosis and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis are major players in 
      cognitive/memory dysfunctions including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interferon beta 
      (IFNβ) is a cytokine with anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective properties on the 
      central nervous system (CNS) cells which specifically affects neural progenitor 
      cells (NPCs) even in the adult brain. In this study, we examined the effect of 
      IFNβ on memory impairment as well as hippocampal neurogenesis and apoptosis in a 
      rat model of AD. AD model was induced by lentiviral-mediated overexpression of 
      mutant APP in the hippocampus of adult rats. Intranasal (IN) administration of 
      IFNβ (0.5 μg/kg and 1 μg/kg doses) was started from day 23 after virus injection 
      and continued every other day to the final day of experiments. The expression 
      levels of APP, neurogenesis (Nestin, Ki67, DCX, and Reelin) and apoptosis 
      (Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cleaved-caspase-3 and seladin-1) markers were evaluated by 
      immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, immunofluorescence and western blotting. 
      Moreover, thioflavin T and Nissl stainings were used to assess Aβ plaque levels 
      and neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus, respectively. Our results showed 
      that IFNβ treatment reduced APP expression and Aβ plaque formation, and 
      concomitantly ameliorated spatial learning and memory deficits examined in Y-maze 
      and Morris water maze tests. Moreover, in parallel with reducing apoptosis and 
      neural loss in the hippocampal subfields, IFNβ decreased ectopic neurogenesis in 
      the CA1 and CA3 regions of the AD rat hippocampus. However, IFNβ increased 
      neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus neurogenic niche. Our findings suggest that 
      IFNβ exerts neuroprotective effects at least partly by inhibition of apoptosis 
      and modulation of neurogenesis. Taken together, IFNβ can be a promising 
      therapeutic approach to improve cognitive performance in AD-like 
      neurodegenerative context.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia worldwide, and 
      there is still no satisfactory drug or therapeutic strategy. Polygala tenuifolia 
      is a traditional Chinese medicine with multiple neuroprotective effects. In 
      present study, we investigated the effects of three active constituents 
      [3,6'-disinapoyl sucrose (DISS), onjisaponin B (OB) and tenuifolin (TEN)] of 
      Polygala tenuifolia (PT) on the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem 
      cells (NSCs) to identify the potential active constituent of PT promoting 
      hippocampal neurogenesis. METHODS: NSCs were isolated from hippocampi of newborn 
      C57BL/6 mice, and transfected with mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene to 
      establish an AD cell model (APP-NSCs). 3-(4,5- 
      Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate 
      dehydrogenase (LDH) assays were performed, and the proliferation and 
      differentiation of NSCs were assessed by neurosphere formation assay, 
      5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay and immunofluorescence (IF) 
      staining analysis. APP/PS1 transgenic mice were administrated with the potential 
      active constituent DISS for 4 weeks. Morris water maze (MWM), Nissl staining 
      assay and IF staining assays were carried out to evaluate the cognitive function, 
      neural damages and hippocampal neurogenesis, respectively. RESULTS: DISS exerted 
      the optimal ability to strengthen APP-NSCs proliferation and neuronal 
      differentiation, followed by OB and TEN. Furthermore, DISS treatment for 4 weeks 
      strikingly rescued the cognitive deficits, neuronal injures, and neurogenesis

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disturbance leading 
      to memory deficit, cognitive decline, and behavioral disturbance. Deposition of 
      Amyloid beta plaques, neurofibrillary tangle and mitochondrial impairment are 
      common neuropathological signs in AD. In this study, the effect of standardized 
      Cyperus rotundus(C. rotundus) extract in three different doses of 250, 500, and 
      750 mg/kg on memory, neurogenesis and mitochondrial mass in the beta amyloid rat 
      model was assessed. For this purpose, 42 male Wistar rats were randomly divided 
      into six groups (n = 7) to evaluate baseline training performance in Morris water 
      maze test. Amyloid beta (Aβ) was injected in animal hippocampal CA1 bilaterally 
      in four groups. After 21 days, a decrease was observed in spending time in target 
      quadrant in the first probe trial in Aβ injected groups. Following that, 250, 
      500, and 750 mg/kg of C. rotundus extracts were administered to three out of four 
      groups for a period of one month. BrdU (Bromodeoxyuridine) was intraperitoneally 
      injected in all groups on the last 7 days of treatment. Then, 28 days after the 
      last BrdU injection, the second probe trial was run, and rats were sacrificed. 
      The neurogenesis and mitochondrial distribution were detected in hippocampus, by 
      immunohistochemical staining. At last, it was observed that C. rotundus, almost 
      recovered memory impairment, in addition to increasing in mitochondrial mass in 
      CA1 and neurogenesis in dentate gyruse in the beta-amyloid rat model of 
      Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Early Stroke Induces Long-Term Impairment of Adult Neurogenesis Accompanied by 
      Hippocampal-Mediated Cognitive Decline.
LID - 10.3390/cells8121654 [doi]
LID - 1654
AB  - Stroke increases neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus in the short term, 
      however, long-term effects at the cellular and functional level are poorly 
      understood. Here we evaluated the impact of an early stroke lesion on 
      neurogenesis and cognitive function of the aging brain. We hypothesized that a 
      stroke disturbs dentate neurogenesis during aging correlate with impaired 
      flexible learning. To address this issue a stroke was induced in 3-month-old 
      C57Bl/6 mice by a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). To verify long-term 
      changes of adult neurogenesis the thymidine analogue BrdU 
      (5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) was administrated at different time points during 
      aging. One and half months after BrdU injections learning and memory performance 
      were assessed with a modified version of the Morris water maze (MWM) that 
      includes the re-learning paradigm, as well as hippocampus-dependent and 
      -independent search strategies. After MWM performance mice were transcardially 
      perfused. To further evaluate in detail the stroke-mediated changes on stem- and 
      progenitor cells as well as endogenous proliferation nestin-green-fluorescent 
      protein (GFP) mice were used. Adult nestin-GFP mice received a retroviral vector 
      injection in the hippocampus to evaluate changes in the neuronal morphology. At 
      an age of 20 month the nestin-GFP mice were transcardially perfused after MWM 
      performance and BrdU application 1.5 months later. The early stroke lesion 
      significantly decreased neurogenesis in 7.5- and 9-month-old animals and also 
      endogenous proliferation in the latter group. Furthermore, immature doublecortin 
      (DCX)-positive neurons were reduced in 20-month-old nestin-GFP mice after lesion. 
      All MCAO groups showed an impaired performance in the MWM and mostly relied on 
      hippocampal-independent search strategies. These findings indicate that an early 
      ischemic insult leads to a dramatical decline of neurogenesis during aging that 
      correlates with a premature development of hippocampal-dependent deficits. Our 
      study supports the notion that an early stroke might lead to long-term cognitive 
      deficits as observed in human patients after lesion.

TI  - Pentraxin 3 contributes to neurogenesis after traumatic brain injury in mice.
PG  - 2318-2326
LID - 10.4103/1673-5374.285001 [doi]
AB  - Emerging evidence indicates that pentraxin 3 is an acute-phase protein that is 
      linked with the immune response to inflammation. It is also a newly discovered 
      marker of anti-inflammatory A2 reactive astrocytes, and potentially has multiple 
      protective effects in stroke; however, its role in the adult brain after 
      traumatic brain injury is unknown. In the present study, a moderate model of 
      traumatic brain injury in mice was established using controlled cortical impact. 
      The models were intraventricularly injected with recombinant pentraxin 3 (the 
      recombinant pentraxin 3 group) or an equal volume of vehicle (the control group). 
      The sham-operated mice underwent craniotomy, but did not undergo the controlled 
      cortical impact. The potential neuroprotective and neuroregenerative roles of 
      pentraxin 3 were investigated on days 14 and 21 after traumatic brain injury. 
      Western blot assay showed that the expression of endogenous pentraxin 3 was 
      increased after traumatic brain injury in mice. Furthermore, the neurological 
      severity test and wire grip test revealed that recombinant pentraxin 3 treatment 
      reduced the neurological severity score and increased the wire grip score, 
      suggesting an improved recovery of sensory-motor functions. The Morris water maze 
      results demonstrated that recombinant pentraxin 3 treatment reduced the latency 
      to the platform, increased the time spent in the correct quadrant, and increased 
      the number of times traveled across the platform, thus suggesting an improved 
      recovery of cognitive function. In addition, to investigate the effects of 
      pentraxin 3 on astrocytes, specific markers of A2 astrocytes were detected in 
      primary astrocyte cultures in vitro using western blot assay. The results 
      demonstrated that pentraxin 3 administration activates A2 astrocytes. To explore 
      the protective mechanisms of pentraxin 3, immunofluorescence staining was used. 
      Intraventricular injection of recombinant pentraxin 3 increased neuronal 
      maintenance in the peri-injured cortex and ipsilateral hippocampus, increased the 
      number of doublecortin-positive neural progenitor cells in the subventricular and 
      subgranular zones, and increased the number of bromodeoxyuridine (proliferation) 
      and neuronal nuclear antigen (mature neuron) double-labeled cells in the 
      hippocampus and peri-injured cortex. Pentraxin 3 administration also increased 
      the number of neurospheres and the number of bromodeoxyuridine and doublecortin 
      double-labeled cells in neurospheres, and enhanced the proliferation of neural 
      progenitor cells in primary neural progenitor cell cultures in vitro. In 
      conclusion, recombinant pentraxin 3 administration activated A2 astrocytes, and 
      consequently improved the recovery of neural function by increasing neuronal 
      survival and enhancing neurogenesis. All experiments were approved by the Animal 
      Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical 
      University, China on March 1, 2016.

AB  - The decline in neurogenesis is a very critical problem in Alzheimer disease. 
      Different biological activities have been reported for medicinal application of 
      quercetin. Herein, we investigated the neurogenesis potential of quercetin in a 
      rat model of Alzheimer's disease induced by amyloid-beta injection. Rats were 
      randomly divided into Control, Alzheimer + Saline and Alzheimer + Quercetin 
      groups. Following the administration of Amyloid-beta, rats in the 
      Alzheimer + Quercetin group received 40 mg/kg/day quercetin orally for one month. 
      Our data demonstrated amyloid-β injection could impair learning and memory 
      processing in rats indicated by passive avoidance test evaluation. We noted that 
      one-month quercetin treatment alleviated the detrimental effects of amyloid-β on 
      spatial learning and memory parameters using Morris water maze analysis. 
      Quercetin was found to increase the number of proliferating neural 
      stem/progenitor cells. Notably, quercetin increased the number of DCX-expressing 
      cells, indicating the active dynamic growth of neural progenitor cells in the 
      dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. We further observed that the quercetin improved 
      the number of BrdU/NeuN positive cells contributed to enhanced adult 
      neurogenesis. Based on our results, quercetin had the potential to promote the 
      expression of BDNF, NGF, CREB, and EGR-1 genes involved in regulating 
      neurogenesis. These data suggest that quercetin can play a valuable role in 
      alleviating Alzheimer's disease symptoms by enhancing adult neurogenesis 
      mechanism.

AB  - Cell surface neural adhesion proteins are critical components in the complex 
      orchestration of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and neuritogenesis essential for 
      proper brain construction and behavior. We focused on the impact of two 
      plasticity-associated IgLON family neural adhesion molecules, Neurotrimin (Ntm) 
      and Limbic system associated membrane protein (Lsamp), on mouse behavior and its 
      underlying neural development. Phenotyping neurons derived from the hippocampi of 
      Lsamp(-/-), Ntm(-/-) and Lsamp(-/-)Ntm(-/-) mice was performed in parallel with 
      behavioral testing. While the anatomy of mutant brains revealed no gross changes, 
      the Ntm(-/-) hippocampal neurons exhibited premature sprouting of neurites and 
      manifested accelerated neurite elongation and branching. We propose that Ntm 
      exerts an inhibitory impact on neurite outgrowth, whereas Lsamp appears to be an 
      enhancer of the said process as premature neuritogenesis in Ntm(-/-) neurons is 
      apparent only in the presence of Lsamp. We also show interplay between Lsamp and 
      Ntm in regulating tissue homeostasis: the impact of Ntm on cellular proliferation 
      was dependent on Lsamp, and Lsamp appeared to be a positive regulator of 
      apoptosis in the presence of Ntm. Behavioral phenotyping indicated test-specific 
      interactions between Lsamp and Ntm. The phenotypes of single mutant lines, such 
      as reduced swimming speed in Morris water maze and increased activity in the 
      elevated plus maze, were magnified in Lsamp(-/-)Ntm(-/-) mice. Altogether, 
      evidence both from behavioral experiments and cultured hippocampal cells show 
      combined and differential interactions between Ntm and Lsamp in the formation of 
      hippocampal circuits and behavioral profiles. We demonstrate that mutual 
      interactions between IgLON molecules regulate the initiation of neurite sprouting 
      at very early ages, and even cell-autonomously, independent of their regulation 
      of cell-cell adhesion.

TI  - Delayed and Abbreviated Environmental Enrichment after Brain Trauma Promotes 
      Motor and Cognitive Recovery That Is Not Contingent on Increased Neurogenesis.
PG  - 756-767
LID - 10.1089/neu.2018.5866 [doi]
AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) confers motor and cognitive recovery in 
      pre-clinical models of traumatic brain injury (TBI), and neurogenesis has been 
      attributed to mediating the benefits. Whether that ascription is correct has not 
      been fully investigated. Hence, the goal of the current study is to further 
      clarify the possible role of learning-induced hippocampal neurogenesis on 
      functional recovery after cortical impact or sham injury by utilizing two EE 
      paradigms (i.e., early + continuous, initiated immediately after TBI and 
      presented 24 h/day; and delayed + abbreviated, initiated 4 days after TBI for 
      6 h/day) and comparing them to one another as well as to standard (STD) housed 
      controls. Motor and cognitive performance was assessed on post-operative Days 1-5 
      and 14-19, respectively, for the STD and early + continuous EE groups and on Days 
      4-8 and 17-22, for the delayed + abbreviated EE groups. Rats were injected with 
      bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 500 mg/ kg; intraperitoneally) for 3 days (12 h apart) 
      before cognitive training and sacrificed 1 week later for quantification of BrdU+ 
      and doublecortin (DCX+) labeled cells. Both early + continuous and delayed + 
      abbreviated EE promoted motor and cognitive recovery after TBI, relative to STD 
      (p < 0.05), and did not differ from one another (p > 0.05). However, only early + 
      continuous EE increased DCX+ cells beyond the level of STD-housed controls 
      (p < 0.05). No effect of EE on non-injured controls was observed. Based on these 
      data, two novel conclusions emerged. First, EE does not need to be provided early 
      and continuously after TBI to confer benefits, which lends credence to the 
      delayed + abbreviated EE paradigm as a relevant pre-clinical model of 
      neurorehabilitation. Second, the functional recovery observed after TBI in the 
      delayed + abbreviated EE paradigm is not contingent on increased hippocampal 
      neurogenesis. Future studies will elucidate alternate viable mechanisms mediating 
      the benefits induced by EE.

TI  - FRMPD4 mutations cause X-linked intellectual disability and disrupt dendritic 
      spine morphogenesis.
PG  - 589-600
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddx426 [doi]
AB  - FRMPD4 (FERM and PDZ Domain Containing 4) is a neural scaffolding protein that 
      interacts with PSD-95 to positively regulate dendritic spine morphogenesis, and 
      with mGluR1/5 and Homer to regulate mGluR1/5 signaling. We report the genetic and 
      functional characterization of 4 FRMPD4 deleterious mutations that cause a new 
      X-linked intellectual disability (ID) syndrome. These mutations were found to be 
      associated with ID in ten affected male patients from four unrelated families, 
      following an apparent X-linked mode of inheritance. Mutations include deletion of 
      an entire coding exon, a nonsense mutation, a frame-shift mutation resulting in 
      premature termination of translation, and a missense mutation involving a highly 
      conserved amino acid residue neighboring FRMPD4-FERM domain. Clinical features of 
      these patients consisted of moderate to severe ID, language delay and seizures 
      alongside with behavioral and/or psychiatric disturbances. In-depth functional 
      studies showed that a frame-shift mutation, FRMPD4p.Cys618ValfsX8, results in a 
      disruption of FRMPD4 binding with PSD-95 and HOMER1, and a failure to increase 
      spine density in transfected hippocampal neurons. Behavioral studies of frmpd4-KO 
      mice identified hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory deficits in 
      Morris Water Maze test. These findings point to an important role of FRMPD4 in 
      normal cognitive development and function in humans and mice, and support the 
      hypothesis that FRMPD4 mutations cause ID by disrupting dendritic spine 
      morphogenesis in glutamatergic neurons.

TI  - Local Klotho Enhances Neuronal Progenitor Proliferation in the Adult Hippocampus.
PG  - 1043-1051
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glx248 [doi]
AB  - Klotho is an aging-related protein associated with hippocampal cognitive 
      performance in mammals. Klotho regulates progenitor cell proliferation in 
      non-neuronal tissues, but its role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) has 
      not been explored. Klotho expression in the adult mouse hippocampus was examined 
      by immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction. AHN was evaluated in the 
      hippocampus of klotho knock-out mice (KO), klotho KO/vitamin D-receptor mutant 
      mice, and in a model of local klotho hippocampal knockdown. The recombinant 
      Klotho effect on proliferation was measured in mouse-derived hippocampal neural 
      progenitor cells. Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed by a dry-land version 
      of the Morris water maze. Klotho was expressed in the granular cell layer of the 
      adult Dentate Gyrus. AHN was increased in klotho KO mice, but not in klotho 
      KO/vitamin D-receptor mutant mice. Inversely, local downregulation of hippocampal 
      Klotho diminished AHN. Recombinant Klotho increased the proliferation rate of 
      neural progenitors. Downregulation of hippocampal Klotho correlated with a 
      decreased performance in hippocampal-dependent memory. These results suggest that 
      Klotho directly participates in regulating AHN. Our observations indicate that 
      Klotho promotes proliferation, AHN and hippocampal-dependent cognition. Increased 
      neurogenesis in klotho KO mice may be secondary to the activation of other 
      pathways altered in the model, such as vitamin D.

TI  - The Neurogenesis Actuator and NR2B/NMDA Receptor Antagonist Ro25-6981 
      Consistently Improves Spatial Memory Retraining Via Brain Region-Specific Gene 
      Expression.
PG  - 167-178
LID - 10.1007/s12031-018-1083-5 [doi]
AB  - NR2B-containing NMDA (NR2B/NMDA) receptors are important in controlling 
      neurogenesis and are involved in generating spatial memory. Ro25-6981 is a 
      selective antagonist at these receptors and actuates neurogenesis and spatial 
      memory. Inter-structural neuroanatomical profiles of gene expression regulating 
      adult neurogenesis and neuroapoptosis require examination in the context of 
      memory retrieval and reversal learning. The aim was to investigate spatial memory 
      retrieval and reversal learning in relation to gene expression-linked 
      neurogenetic processes following blockade of NR2B/NMDA receptors by Ro25-6981. 
      Rats were trained in Morris water maze (MWM) platform location for 5 days. 
      Ro25-6981 was administered (protocol days 6-7) followed by retraining (days 15-18 
      or 29-32). Platform location was tested (on days 19 or 33) then post-mortem brain 
      tissue sampling (on days 20 or 34). The expression of three genes known to 
      regulate cell proliferation (S100a6), differentiation (Ascl1), and apoptosis 
      (Casp-3) were concomitantly evaluated in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and 
      cerebellum in relation to the MWM performance protocol. Following initial 
      training, Ro25-6981 enhanced visuospatial memory retrieval performance during 
      further retraining (protocol days 29-32) but did not influence visuospatial 
      reversal learning (day 33). Hippocampal Ascl1 and Casp-3 expressions were 
      correspondingly increased and decreased while cerebellar S100a6 and Casp-3 
      activities were decreased and increased respectively 27 days after Ro25-6981 
      treatment. Chronological analysis indicated a possible involvement of new mature 
      neurons in the reconfiguration of memory processes. This was attended by 
      behavioral/gene correlations which revealed direct links between spatial memory 
      retrieval enhancement and modified gene activity induced by NR2B/NMDA receptor 
      blockade and upregulation.

TI  - Yokukansan Ameliorates Hippocampus-Dependent Learning Impairment in 
      Senescence-Accelerated Mouse.

AB  - Yokukansan (YKS) is a traditional Japanese herbal medicine. It has been currently 
      applied for treating behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in Japan. 
      We investigated the effect of YKS on learning ability, hippocampal cell 
      proliferation, and neural ultrastructural features in senescence-accelerated 
      mouse prone 8 (SAMP8), a proposed animal model of Alzheimer's disease. 
      Five-month-old male SAMP8 mice were randomly assigned to control and experimental 
      groups. The control group had drug-free water ad libitum. The experimental mice 
      were given 0.15% aqueous solution of YKS orally for eight weeks. Learning ability 
      was assessed in Morris water maze test. Hippocampal cell proliferation was 
      investigated using bromodeoxyuridine immunohistochemical method. The neural 
      ultrastructural features, including myelin sheath and synapse, were investigated 
      electron microscopy. Administration with YKS improved the hippocampal cell 
      proliferation in dentate gyrus, and ameliorated learning impairment in SAMP8 
      mice. Numerous lipofuscin inclusions were presented in hippocampal neurons of the 
      control mice. However, little were found after treatment with YKS. Myelin sheath 
      was thicker and postsynaptic density length was longer after treatment with YKS. 
      Administration with YKS ameliorated learning impairment in SAMP8 mice, mediated 
      at least partially via delaying neuronal aging process, neurogenesis, myelin 
      sheath and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. These results suggest that YKS 
      might be effective for preventing hippocampus-dependent cognitive deficits with 
      age.

AB  - Koumine (KM) is a major alkaloid monomer in the traditional Chinese medicine herb 
      Gelsemium elegans Benth that has exhibited therapeutic potential in clinical 
      applications. However, the pharmacological toxicological mechanism of this drug 
      has not been fully explored. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
      impacts of KM administration at a therapeutic dose in offspring. On gestational 
      day 0, mice were injected with KM once daily for 4 consecutive days. Male and 
      female offspring were subjected to behavioral tests and neuropathological 
      analyses from postnatal day 60. Prenatal KM exposure resulted in cognitive and 
      memory impairments in the Morris water maze, Y-maze test, and novel object 
      recognition test. The open field test and elevated plus maze test indicated that 
      prenatal KM exposure induced anxiety-like behavior in offspring. 
      Electrophysiological experiments demonstrated that KM exposure inhibited 
      hippocampal long-term potentiation. Immunostaining for neurogenesis markers DCX 
      and BrdU demonstrated that KM suppressed adult neurogenesis in the subgranular 
      zone of the dentate gyrus. In addition, prenatal KM exposure induced a 
      significant reduction in dendritic spine density in hippocampal neurons. Synaptic 
      formation-related proteins were decreased in the KM group based on western blot. 
      No sex differences in the effects of KM were observed. Collectively, our results 
      indicate that prenatal KA exposure has detrimental neural effects on offspring. 
      This study provides a preliminary preclinical toxicological assessment of the 
      safety of KM use during pregnancy.

AB  - Early-life stress (ES) increases the risk for psychopathology and cognitive 
      decline later in life. Because the neurobiological substrates affected by ES 
      (i.e., cognition, neuroplasticity, and neuroinflammation) are also altered in 
      aging, we set out to investigate if and how ES in the first week of life affects 
      these domains at an advanced age, and how ES modulates the aging trajectory per 
      se. We subjected C57BL/6j mice to an established ES mouse model from postnatal 
      days 2-9. Mice underwent behavioral testing at 19 months of age and were 
      sacrificed at 20 months to investigate their physiology, hippocampal 
      neuroplasticity, neuroinflammation, and telomere length. ES mice, as a group, did 
      not perform differently from controls in the open field or Morris water maze 
      (MWM). Hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic marker gene expression were not 
      different in ES mice at this age. While we find aging-associated alterations to 
      neuroinflammatory gene expression and telomere length, these were unaffected by 
      ES. When integrating the current data with those from our previously reported 4- 
      and 10-month-old cohorts, we conclude that ES leads to a 'premature' shift in the 
      aging trajectory, consisting of early changes that do not further worsen at the 
      advanced age of 20 months. This could be explained e.g. by a 'floor' effect in 
      ES-induced impairments, and/or age-induced impairments in control mice. Future 
      studies should help understand how exactly ES affects the overall aging 
      trajectory.

AB  - Exercise enhances cognitive function through increased neurogenesis but can also 
      cause neurogenesis-induced forgetting. It remains unclear whether the diminished 
      memory traces are completely forgotten. Our goals were to determine whether 
      spatial memory is diminished by exercise, and if so, whether the memory is 
      completely gone or whether only the local details disappear but not the acquired 
      strategy. Two-month-old male C57BL/6J mice were trained on a spatial memory task 
      using the Morris water maze and tested to determine that they had learned the 
      platform location. Another mouse group received no training. Half the mice in 
      each group then exercised on a running wheel, while the other half remained 
      sedentary in home cages. After 4 weeks of this, previously trained mice were 
      tested for their retention of the platform location. All mice were then subjected 
      to the task, but the platform was located in a different position (reversal 
      learning for previously trained mice). We found that exercise significantly 
      facilitated the forgetting of the first platform location (i.e., diminished 
      spatial memory) but also significantly enhanced reversal learning. Compared with 
      mice that received no pre-exercise training, mice that had been previously 
      trained, even those in the exercise group that had decreased recall, showed 
      significantly better performance in the reversal learning test. Activation of new 
      adult-born neurons was also examined. Although newborn neuron activation between 
      groups that had or had not received prior task training was not different, 
      activation was significantly higher in exercise groups than in sedentary groups 
      after the probe test for reversal learning. These results indicated that the 
      experience of pre-exercise training equally facilitated new learning in the 
      sedentary and exercise groups, even though significantly lower memory retention 
      was found in the exercise group, suggesting rule-based learning in mice. 
      Furthermore, newborn neurons equally participated in similar and novel memory 
      acquisition.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is known that an interruption of acoustic input in early life 
      will result in abnormal development of the auditory system. Here, we further show 
      that this negative impact actually spans beyond the auditory system to the 
      hippocampus, a system critical for spatial memory. METHODS: We induced a 
      temporary conductive hearing loss (TCHL) in P14 rats by perforating the eardrum 
      and allowing it to heal. The Morris water maze and Y-maze tests were deployed to 
      evaluate spatial memory of the rats. Electrophysiological recordings and 
      anatomical analysis were made to evaluate functional and structural changes in 
      the hippocampus following TCHL. RESULTS: The rats with the TCHL had nearly normal 
      hearing at P42, but had a decreased performance with the Morris water maze and 
      Y-maze tests compared with the control group. A functional deficit in the 
      hippocampus of the rats with the TCHL was found as revealed by the depressed 
      long-term potentiation and the reduced NMDA receptor-mediated postsynaptic 
      current. A structural deficit in the hippocampus of those animals was also found 
      as revealed the abnormal expression of the NMDA receptors, the decreased number 
      of dendritic spines, the reduced postsynaptic density and the reduced level of 
      neurogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that even temporary auditory 
      sensory deprivation in early life of rats results in abnormal development of the 
      hippocampus and consequently impairs spatial memory in adulthood.

AB  - Cend1 is a neuronal-lineage specific modulator involved in coordination of cell 
      cycle exit and differentiation of neuronal precursors. We have previously shown 
      that Cend1(-/-) mice show altered cerebellar layering caused by increased 
      proliferation of granule cell precursors, delayed radial granule cell migration 
      and compromised Purkinje cell differentiation, leading to ataxic gait and 
      deficits in motor coordination. To further characterize the effects of Cend1 
      genetic ablation we determined herein a range of behaviors, including anxiety and 
      exploratory behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM), associative learning in 
      fear conditioning, and spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze 
      (MWM). We observed significant deficits in all tests, suggesting structural 
      and/or functional alterations in brain regions such as the cortex, amygdala and 
      the hippocampus. In agreement with these findings, immunohistochemistry revealed 
      reduced numbers of γ amino butyric acid (GABA) GABAergic interneurons, but not of 
      glutamatergic projection neurons, in the adult cerebral cortex. Reduced GABAergic 
      interneurons were also observed in the amygdala, most notably in the basolateral 
      nucleus. The paucity in GABAergic interneurons in adult Cend1(-/-) mice 
      correlated with increased proliferation and apoptosis as well as reduced 
      migration of neuronal progenitors from the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence 
      (MGE), the origin of these cells. Further we noted reduced GABAergic neurons and 
      aberrant neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, which 
      has been previously shown to confer spatial learning and memory deficits. Our 
      data highlight the necessity of Cend1 expression in the formation of a 
      structurally and functionally normal brain phenotype.

AB  - Laboratory studies suggested that general anesthetics induce neuroapoptosis and 
      inhibit neurogenesis in developing brains of animals. Minocycline exerts 
      neuroprotection against a wide range of toxic insults in neurodegenerative 
      diseases models. Here, we investigate whether minocycline can alleviate 
      neurogenetic damage and improve cognition following midazolam exposure in 
      neonatal rats. Postnatal 7 days rats were divided randomly into three groups: 
      control group (C), midazolam group (M), and minocycline pretreatment group (MP). 
      After exposure to midazolam, the cell proliferation in the subventricular zone 
      (SVZ) and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus in pups was analyzed by 
      bromodeoxyuridine immunochemistry at 7 days after the administration of 
      anesthesia. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water-maze test at 
      35 days after midazolam exposure. Compared with the control, midazolam reduced 
      cell proliferation both in the SVZ and in the SGZ of the hippocampus of neonatal 
      rats, and decreased spatial learning and memory ability of rats in adulthood 
      significantly. Pretreatment with minocycline increased cell proliferation both in 
      the SVZ and in the SGZ of the hippocampus and improved spatial learning and 
      memory ability compared with midazolam, but it did not mitigate the changes to 
      the normal levels compared with the controls. Our results indicated that 
      pretreatment with minocycline can alleviate midazolam-induced damage in neural 
      stem cell proliferation of neonatal rats and improve spatial learning and memory 
      ability of rats in adulthood.

AB  - Learning experiences are potent modulators of adult hippocampal neurogenesis 
      (AHN). However, the vast majority of findings on the learning-induced regulation 
      of AHN derive from aversively-motivated tasks, mainly the water maze paradigm, in 
      which stress is a confounding factor that affects the AHN outcome. Currently, 
      little is known regarding the effect of appetitively-motivated training on AHN. 
      Hence we studied how spatial learning to find food rewards in a hole-board maze 
      modulates AHN (cell proliferation and immature neurons) and AHN-related 
      hippocampal neuroplasticity markers (BDNF, IGF-II and CREB phosphorylation) in 
      mice. The 'Trained' mice were tested for both spatial reference and working 
      memory and compared to 'Pseudotrained' mice (exposed to different baited holes in 
      each session, thus avoiding the reference memory component of the task) and 
      'Control' mice (exposed to the maze without rewards). In contrast to 
      Pseudotrained and Control mice, the number of proliferating hippocampal cells 
      were reduced in Trained mice, but they notably increased their population of 
      immature neurons assessed by immunohistochemistry. This evidence shows that 
      hole-board spatial reference learning diminishes cell proliferation in favor of 
      enhancing young neurons' survival. Interestingly, the enhanced AHN in the Trained 
      mice (specifically in the suprapyramidal blade) positively correlated with their 
      reference memory performance, but not with their working memory. Furthermore, the 
      Trained animals increased the hippocampal protein expression of all the 
      neuroplasticity markers analyzed by western blot. Results show that the 
      appetitively-motivated hole-board task is a useful paradigm to potentiate and/or 
      investigate AHN and hippocampal plasticity minimizing aversive variables such as 
      fear or stress.

TI  - Neuroprotective Effect of S-trans, Trans-farnesylthiosalicylic Acid via 
      Inhibition of RAS/ERK Pathway for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 4053-4063

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a leading cause of dementia, becomes a 
      serious health issue for individuals and society around the world. AD is a 
      neurodegenerative disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) 
      peptides and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and the loss of large numbers of 
      neurons. To date, there is no effective treatment for AD, and thus, to enhance 
      neurogenesis in the AD brain may be a therapeutic strategy. RAS signaling pathway 
      involves in synaptic plasticity and memory formation, which is overexpressed in 
      brains with AD. This study used Aβ(1-42)-injected mice (Aβ(1-42)-mice) as the AD 
      model to investigate the effects of S-trans, trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid 
      (FTS), a synthetic Ras inhibitor, on the impairment of neurogenesis and the 
      spatial cognitive deﬁcits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AD model mice were manufactured 
      through intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ(1-42). Morris water maze (MWM) 
      was performed to evaluate the capacity of spatial memory, and Nissl staining was 
      applied to assess neuronal damage in the hippocampus CA1. Immunohistochemistry of 
      5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), BrdU/neuronal nuclei (NeuN), and doublecortin 
      (DCX) were used to detect progenitor cell proliferation, maturation, and neurite 
      growth, respectively. And the expression levels of RAS, ERK/ERK phosphorylation 
      (p-ERK) and CREB/CREB phosphorylation (p-CREB) were detected by Western blot. 
      RESULTS: The results demonstrated that FTS could prevent Aβ(1-42) to impair 
      survival and neurite growth of newborn neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus 
      (DG) in Aβ(1-42)-mice. Furthermore, behavioral indexes and morphological findings 
      showed that FTS improved the learning and spatial memory abilities of 
      Aβ(1-42)-mice. In addition, FTS could inhibit the levels of hippocampal p-ERK and 
      p-CREB activated by Aβ, which is the underlying molecular mechanism. CONCLUSION: 
      In conclusion, these findings suggest that FTS as a RAS inhibitor could be a 
      potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD.

      cerebral ischemic mice].
PG  - 5451-5456

AB  - This paper was aimed to investigate the effect of gastrodin( GAS) on hippocampal 
      neurogenesis after cerebral was chemic and to explore its mechanism of action 
      related to NO. The cerebral ischemia model of C57 BL/6 mice was established by 
      bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. The pathological changes in 
      hippocampal CA1 region and the cognitive function of mice were assessed by HE 
      staining and Morris water maze test,respectively. The count of Brd U/Neu N 
      positive cells in dentate gyrus was detected by immunofluorescence assay. The NOS 
      activity and the NO content were determined by colorimetric and nitrate reduction 
      methods,respectively.The level of c GMP was measured by ELISA kit,and the PKG 
      protein expression was tested by Western blot. On postoperative day 8,the 
      hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of mice showed irregular structure,with obvious 
      nuclear pyknosis,loose cell arrangement and obvious decrease in the number of 
      neurons. On postoperative day 29,the spatial learning ability and memory were 
      decreased. These results indicated cerebral ischemia in mice. Meanwhile,the Brd 
      U/Neu N positive cells were increased significantly in ischemic mice,indicating 
      that neurogenesis occurred in hippocampus after cerebral ischemia. Treatment with 
      different doses of gastrodin( 50 and 100 mg·kg-1) significantly ameliorated the 
      pathological damages in the CA1 region,improved the ability of learning and 
      memory,and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis. At the same time,both the NOS 
      activity and the NO concentration were decreased in model group,but the c GMP 
      level was increased,and the PKG protein expression was up-regulated. Gastrodin 
      administration activated the NOS activity,promoted NO production,further 
      increased c GMP level and up-regulated PKG protein expression. These results 
      suggested that gastrodin can promote hippocampal neurogenesis after cerebral 
      ischemia and improve cognitive function in mice,which may be related to the 
      activation of NO-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway.

AB  - The possibility that exposure to inhalation anaesthetics inhibits neurogenesis 
      and results in memory deficits has attracted considerable interest over the past 
      decade. This study was designed to investigate the mechanism of the sevoflurane 
      exposure-induced decline in hippocampal neurogenesis. Young mice were 
      anaesthetized with a gaseous mixture of 3.0% sevoflurane/60% oxygen 2 h daily for 
      three consecutive days. Sodium butyrate (NaB) administration began 2 h prior to 
      anaesthesia and continued daily until the end of behavioural tests. The Morris 
      water maze (MWM) test was used to determine spatial learning and memory 
      performance. We assessed the effect of repeated sevoflurane exposure on histone 
      acetylation and the expression of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and its 
      receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB), in the hippocampus by 
      Western blot (WB). To detect neurogenesis, we first counted the number of neural 
      stem cells (NSCs); we then assessed their proliferation level by 
      immunohistochemistry and estimated the number of new-born cells by 
      immunofluorescence. We found that sevoflurane induced learning and memory 
      deficits in young mice 4 weeks after sevoflurane exposure and that NaB injection 
      restored histone acetylation and improved the performance of the mice in the MWM. 
      NaB also increased the number and proliferation of NSCs and neonatal cells, which 
      were inhibited by sevoflurane. Concomitantly, BDNF and TrkB expression, which was 
      decreased by sevoflurane, was also restored by NaB. Our study showed that 
      sevoflurane affects long-term neurocognitive function and neurogenesis in young 
      mice. Normalization of histone acetylation may alleviate the neurodevelopmental 
      side effects of this anaesthetic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke remains a leading cause of adult disability and the demand for 
      stroke rehabilitation services is growing, and Astragaloside IV (As IV), a 
      primary bioactive compound of Radix Astragali : Astragalus mongholicus Bunge 
      (Fabaceae), may be a promising stroke therapy. METHODS: To access the effect of 
      As IV on adult mice after ischemic stroke, a photochemical ischemia model was 
      established on C57BL/6 mice, which were intravenously administered As IV for 
      three consecutive days later. And then the cognitive benefits and hippocampal 
      neurogenesis were evaluated by Morris Water Maze (MWM) test, Golgi staining, and 
      immunohistochemical staining in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, to find out the 
      underlying mechanism, interleukin-17 (IL-17) knockout (KO) mice were used, 
      through RNA sequence (RNA-seq) analysis and immunohistochemistry. Then the 
      mechanism of neurogenesis promoted by As IV was observed by western blot both in 
      vivo and in vitro. Specifically, As IV, recombinant mouse IL-17A and IL-17F, and 
      Wingless/integrated (Wnt)-expressing virus was administered respectively in 
      neural stem cells (NSCs), and then their diameters and protein expression of 
      Nestin, IL-17, and Wnt pathway relevant protein, were measured in vitro. RESULTS: 
      Administering As IV resulted in significant amelioration of stroke-induced 
      cognitive deficits. And more hippocampal neurons with normal morphology, 
      significant increments in the length of the apical dendrites, and the density of 
      their spines were observed in As IV-treated mice. Furthermore, the 
      immunohistochemistry staining of DCX/BrdU and Sox2/Nestin showed As IV could 
      promote hippocampal neurogenesis and NSC proliferation after ischemic stroke, as 
      well as in vitro. For the mechanism underlying, IL-17 expression was 
      downregulated significantly by As IV treatment and knocking out IL-17 was 
      associated with nervous regeneration and synapse repair according to the analysis 
      of RNA-seq. Consistent to As IV treatment, knocking out IL-17 showed some 
      promotion on hippocampal neurogenesis and proliferation of NSCs, with activating 
      Wnt pathway after stoke. Finally, in vitro, NSCs' diameters and protein 
      expression of Nestin, IL-17, and Wnt pathway were regulated by either 
      administering As IV or inhibiting IL-17. CONCLUSION: As IV stimulates hippocampal 
      neurogenesis after stroke, thus potentially facilitates brain to remodel and 
      repair by downregulating IL-17 expression via Wnt pathway.

TI  - Transplantation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Overexpressing Fibroblast Growth Factor 
      21 Facilitates Cognitive Recovery and Enhances Neurogenesis in a Mouse Model of 
      Traumatic Brain Injury.
PG  - 14-26
LID - 10.1089/neu.2019.6422 [doi]
AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a progressive and complex pathological condition 
      that results in multiple adverse consequences, including impaired learning and 
      memory. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has produced limited 
      benefits in experimental TBI models. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a 
      novel metabolic regulator that has neuroprotective effects, promotes 
      remyelination, enhances angiogenesis, and elongates astrocytic processes. In this 
      study, MSCs were genetically engineered to overexpress FGF21 in order to improve 
      their efficacy in TBI. MSCs overexpressing FGF21 (MSC-FGF21) were transplanted to 
      mouse brain by intracerebroventricular injection 24 h after TBI was induced by 
      controlled cortical impact (CCI). Hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and 
      memory, assessed by the Morris water maze test, was markedly decreased 3-4 weeks 
      after TBI, a deficit that was robustly recovered by treatment with MSC-FGF21, but 
      not MSC-mCherry control. Hippocampus-independent learning and memory, assessed by 
      the novel object recognition test, was also impaired; these effects were blocked 
      by treatment with both MSC-FGF21 and MSC-mCherry control. FGF21 protein levels in 
      the ipsilateral hippocampus were drastically reduced 4 weeks post-TBI, a loss 
      that was restored by treatment with MSC-FGF21, but not MSC-mCherry. MSC-FGF21 
      treatment also partially restored TBI-induced deficits in neurogenesis and 
      maturation of immature hippocampal neurons, whereas MSC-mCherry was less 
      effective. Finally, MSC-FGF21 treatment also normalized TBI-induced impairments 
      in dendritic arborization of hippocampal neurons. Taken together, the results 
      indicate that MSC-FGF21 treatment significantly improved TBI-induced spatial 
      memory deficits, impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, and abnormal dendritic 
      morphology. Future clinical investigations using MSC-FGF21 to improve post-TBI 
      outcomes are warranted.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests, as Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses, that its 
      non-motor symptoms appear prior to or in parallel with its motor deficits. 
      Alpha-synuclein A53T transgenic mouse (A53T) is an essential tool to investigate 
      the onsets and the extents of PD non-motor symptoms. Our aim is to investigate 
      spatial learning and memory ability in A53T mice. In our rotarod tests, no motor 
      coordination impairments were detected in mice of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months old. We 
      then investigated their spatial learning and memory ability through Morris water 
      maze in 3- and 9-month-old mice. No significant difference in escape latency was 
      detected among the A53T mice and the control mice. However, an unexpected 
      improvement in spatial learning and memory ability was observed in the probe 
      session among the A53T mice. Reversal learning by Morris water maze also 
      indicated that 3- and 9-month-old A53T mice exhibited a better cognitive 
      flexibility compared to their littermate controls. Further studies by western 
      blots showed that alpha-synuclein expressions in hippocampus of the A53T mice 
      were noticeably up-regulated. The immunofluorescence staining of 
      5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (Brdu) and doublecortin (DCX) demonstrated that neither 
      the Brdu-positive neurons nor the Brdu/DCX positive neurons in hippocampus were 
      significantly altered between the two groups. These results suggest that our A53T 
      mice exhibit improved spatial learning and memory ability prior to their motor 
      coordination deficits. These results are not induced by neurogenesis in the 
      hippocampus.

AB  - Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A)(†,‡) is an essential protein that 
      requires a unique amino acid, hypusine, for its activity. Hypusine is formed 
      exclusively in eIF5A post-translationally via two enzymes, deoxyhypusine synthase 
      (DHPS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase. Each of the genes encoding these proteins, 
      Eif5a, Dhps, and Dohh, is required for mouse embryonic development. Variants in 
      EIF5A or DHPS were recently identified as the genetic basis underlying certain 
      rare neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. To investigate the roles of eIF5A 
      and DHPS in brain development, we generated four conditional KO mouse strains 
      using the Emx1-Cre or Camk2a-Cre strains and examined the effects of temporal- 
      and region-specific deletion of Eif5a or Dhps. The conditional deletion of Dhps 
      or Eif5a by Emx1 promotor-driven Cre expression (E9.5, in the cortex and 
      hippocampus) led to gross defects in forebrain development, reduced growth, and 
      premature death. On the other hand, the conditional deletion of Dhps or Eif5a by 
      Camk2a promoter-driven Cre expression (postnatal, mainly in the CA1 region of the 
      hippocampus) did not lead to global developmental defects; rather, these KO 
      animals exhibited severe impairment in spatial learning, contextual learning, and 
      memory when subjected to the Morris water maze and a contextual learning test. In 
      both models, the Dhps-KO mice displayed more severe impairment than their 
      Eif5a-KO counterparts. The observed defects in the brain, global development, or 
      cognitive functions most likely result from translation errors due to a 
      deficiency in active, hypusinated eIF5A. Our study underscores the important 
      roles of eIF5A and DHPS in neurodevelopment.

AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic (HI) encephalopathy is a devastating injury that occurs when the 
      fetal brain is deprived of oxygen and blood to a degree that may lead to 
      neurological damage, seizing and cerebral palsy. In rodents, early environmental 
      enrichment that promotes maternal care-taking behavior (mCTB) can improve 
      neurobehavioral outcomes and protect against neurological decline. We 
      hypothesized that an enhanced nesting environment would improve mCTB as measured 
      by pup weight gain, and support greater HI recovery in developing rats. Pregnant 
      dams (E15-16) were introduced to either control Standard Facility (SF) housing or 
      closed nestbox (CN) conditions and maintained in larger cages through pup 
      weaning. On postnatal day (PND) 7, male and female Long-Evans rat pups (N = 73) 
      were randomly sorted into one of two surgical conditions: control and HI. HI pups 
      received isoflurane anesthesia and right carotid artery ligation, a 2-h rest 
      followed by 90 min exposure to a moist hypoxic (92% N, 8% O2) chamber. Pups (PND 
      8) were weighed daily, and tested on the Morris Water Maze (MWM) task (PND 
      35-50). Results demonstrate significant differences afforded to male and female 
      pups based on weight measure, where CN-rearing modifies pre-weaning adolescent 
      weights in females and increases post-weaning weights in males and females by an 
      average of 10 g. Following successful MWM training and acquisition (PND 35-37), 
      both male and female CN-raised animals demonstrated faster latency to find the 
      hidden platform (HP) during HP trials (PND 38-42) and appeared to freely explore 
      the MWM pool during an additional probe trial (PND 43). Moreover, after sacrifice 
      (PND 60), CN rearing created sex-specific alterations in brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) 
      immunopositive cell staining of the dorsomedial striatum and CA1 of the 
      hippocampus. CN-rearing afforded HI males higher BDNF levels in the striatum and 
      produced greater GDNF levels in the hippocampus of HI-injured females. These 
      results suggest that early life environmental enrichment positively modifies 
      nesting environment, increases weight gain, as well as spatial learning and 
      memory in a sex-specific directionality. Our findings also implicate correlative 
      changes in corticolimbic neurotrophin protein levels in the CN-reared animals 
      that may contribute to these benefits.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies indicated that circulatory factors in blood plasma 
      from young animals can reactivate neurogenesis, restore synaptic plasticity, and 
      improve cognitive function in aged animals. Here, we investigated if young plasma 
      could have a possible therapeutic effect for treatment of Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD)-like pathologies and cognitive impairment in triple-transgenic AD (3×Tg-AD) 
      mice. METHODS: We intravenously injected plasma from 2- to 3-month-old C57BL/6 J 
      wild-type mice into 16-17-month-old 3×Tg-AD mice twice a week for 8 weeks. The 
      behavioral tests including open field, novel object recognition, Morris water 
      maze, and reversal Morris water maze were conducted after 4-week plasma 
      injections. The effect of young plasma on tau and Aβ pathologies and on the 
      levels of synaptic proteins and neuroinflammation were assessed by Western blots 
      and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Young plasma treatment improved 
      short-term memory in the novel object recognition test and enhanced the spatial 
      learning and memory in Morris water maze test and reversal Morris water maze 
      test. Biochemical studies revealed that young plasma treatment reduced both tau 
      and Aβ pathologies, as well as neuroinflammation in the mouse brain. However, we 
      did not detect any significant changes in levels of synaptic proteins or the 
      dentate gyrus neurogenesis in the mouse brain after the treatment with young 
      plasma. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that young blood plasma not only 
      ameliorates tau and Aβ pathologies but also enhances the cognitive function in 
      3×Tg-AD mice. These findings suggest that transfusion with young blood plasma 
      could be a potentially effective treatment for AD.

AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that sleep deprivation (S-Dep) is a critical risk 
      factor for depression. Electroacupuncture (EA) treatment has been reported to 
      ameliorate posttraumatic stress disorder- (PSTD-) like behavior and enhance 
      hippocampal neurogenesis. However, whether EA treatment has any beneficial effect 
      on S-Dep-induced depression-like behavior is still unknown. In the present study, 
      we focused on whether EA at Baihui (GV20) can ameliorate the deterioration effect 
      of S-Dep in mice. Mice were randomly divided into normal, S-Dep, S-Dep + EA, and 
      S-Dep + sham EA groups. Cognitive behavior test and in vitro assay were performed 
      separately to avoid the influence of behavior test on synaptic transmission and 
      protein expression. Depression-like behaviors were determined by forced swimming 
      test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), and Morris water maze (MWM). Neurogenesis 
      was identified by BrdU, DCX, and NeuN immunofluorescence staining. In vitro 
      long-term potentiation was detected by high frequency stimulation (HFS) at 
      Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices. Brain-derived neurotropic 
      factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) protein expression level 
      were assayed by western blot. Our results indicated that D-Sep mice demonstrated 
      depression-like behaviors determined by prolonged immobility duration in FST and 
      TST; D-Sep mice also manifested spatial memory retention deficit in MWM. 
      Furthermore, EA treatment ameliorated D-Sep-induced depression-like behaviors and 
      spatial memory retention deficit. Mechanically, EA treatment alleviated neuron 
      progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, ameliorated the field 
      excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) slope impaired by S-Dep, and elevated 
      BDNF/TrkB protein expression. Taken together, our data suggested that EA 
      treatment has a protective effect on S-Dep-induced depression-like behavior and 
      cognitive impairment, which may be through regulating BDNF/TrkB protein 
      expression.

TI  - Cannabinoid receptor 2 deficiency enhances isoflurane-induced spatial cognitive 
      impairment in adult mice by affecting neuroinflammation, neurogenesis and 
      neuroplasticity.

AB  - Isoflurane (Iso) is a commonly used inhalational anesthetic and is associated 
      with the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Cannabinoid 
      receptor 2 (CB2R) was previously reported to have a promising neuroprotective 
      function in cases of POCD, but the specific mechanisms have remained to be fully 
      explored. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of CB2R 
      deficiency on spatial cognitive performance in adult mice exposed to Iso. A total 
      of 20 adult CB2R knockout (KO) and 20 wild-type (WT) mice were exposed to Iso 
      (1.4% in oxygen for 4 h) or 100% oxygen. The Morris water maze (MWZ) test was 
      performed 10 days after Iso exposure. Immunofluorescence staining and reverse 
      transcription-quantitative PCR were performed to assess the expression of 
      microglial marker ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba1) and the mRNA 
      expression levels of microglial phenotype markers (M1: Interleukin-6, tumor 
      necrosis factor-α, inducible nitric oxide synthase; M2: Chitinase-3 like protein) 
      in the hippocampus. Changes in hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroplasticity were 
      assessed by 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) immunostaining and Golgi staining. 
      Compared with control mice, WT Iso-exposed mice had impaired spatial performance 
      in the MWZ test. Furthermore, hippocampal Iba1 immunoreactivity and the number of 
      microglial branches were notably increased in Iso-exposed WT mice. This was 
      paralleled by significant upregulation of M1-associated markers and 
      downregulation of M2-associated markers in the hippocampus. An obviously reduced 
      number of BrdU(+) neurons and decreased spine density were observed in WT 
      Iso-exposed mice compared with control mice. Of note, CB2R deficiency exacerbated 
      the spatial cognition impairment induced by Iso in the MWZ test. The alterations 
      in the activation, morphology and M1 polarization of microglia, the number of 
      BrdU(+) neurons and spine density were more pronounced in CB2R-deficient 
      Iso-exposed KO mice than in WT Iso-exposed mice. These results suggested that 
      CB2R has a crucial role in Iso-induced cognitive impairment, which may be related 
      to changes in hippocampal neuroinflammation, neurogenesis and neuroplasticity.

TI  - Stereological Investigation of the Effects of Treadmill Running Exercise on the 
      Hippocampal Neurons in Middle-Aged APP/PS1 Transgenic Mice.

AB  - The risk of cognitive decline during Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be reduced if 
      physical activity is maintained; however, the specific neural events underlying 
      this beneficial effect are still uncertain. To quantitatively investigate the 
      neural events underlying the effect of running exercise on middle-aged AD 
      subjects, 12-month-old male APP/PS1 mice were randomly assigned to a control 
      group or running group, and age-matched non-transgenic littermates were used as a 
      wild-type group. AD running group mice were subjected to a treadmill running 
      protocol (regular and moderate intensity) for four months. Spatial learning and 
      memory abilities were assessed using the Morris water maze. Hippocampal amyloid 
      plaques were observed using Thioflavin S staining and immunohistochemistry. 
      Hippocampal volume, number of neurons, and number of newborn cells (BrdU+ cells) 
      in the hippocampus were estimated using stereological techniques, and newborn 
      neurons were observed using double-labelling immunofluorescence. Marked neuronal 
      loss in both the CA1 field and dentate gyrus (DG) and deficits in both the 
      neurogenesis and survival of new neurons in the DG of middle-aged APP/PS1 mice 
      were observed. Running exercise could improve the spatial learning and memory 
      abilities, reduce amyloid plaques in the hippocampi, delay neuronal loss, induce 
      neurogenesis, and promote the survival of newborn neurons in the DG of 
      middle-aged APP/PS1 mice. Exercise-induced protection of neurons and adult 
      neurogenesis within the DG might be part of the important structural basis of the 
      improved spatial learning and memory abilities observed in AD mice.

AB  - The neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson's disease affects motor abilities as 
      well as cognition. The gold standard therapy is L-Dopa, which mainly restores 
      motor skills. Therefore, we require additional interventions to sustain cognitive 
      functions in Parkinson's disease. The lifestyle intervention "physical activity" 
      improves adult hippocampal neurogenesis and memory but so far, its impact has not 
      been investigated in rodent models for Parkinson's disease previously treated 
      with the standard therapy. We hereby asked whether physical activity serves as a 
      pro-neurogenic and -cognitive stimulus in dopamine-depleted mice previously 
      treated with L-Dopa. Therefore, we injected dopamine-depleted mice with 
      L-Dopa/Benserazide followed either by exercise or by a sedentary lifestyle. We 
      analysed adult hippocampal neurogenesis histologically and assessed spatial 
      memory in the Morris water maze. Furthermore, we investigated the hippocampal and 
      striatal monoaminergic cross-talk. Physical activity prevented memory decline and 
      was linked to a slower dopamine turnover but did not enhance neurogenesis in 
      dopamine-depleted mice previously treated with L-Dopa. In conclusion, physical 
      activity did not develop its full pro-neurogenic potential in mice previously 
      treated with L-Dopa but sustained spatial cognition in Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Physical exercise during adolescence, a critical developmental window, can 
      facilitate neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and astrogliogenesis in Cornu 
      Ammonis (CA) hippocampal subfields of rats, and which have been associated with 
      improved hippocampal dependent memory performance. Recent translational studies 
      in humans also suggest that aerobic fitness is associated with hippocampal volume 
      and better spatial memory during adolescence. However, associations between 
      fitness, hippocampal subfield morphology, and learning capabilities in human 
      adolescents remain largely unknown. Employing a translational study design in 34 
      adolescent males, we explored the relationship between aerobic fitness, 
      hippocampal subfield volumes, and both spatial and verbal memory. Aerobic 
      fitness, assessed by peak oxygen utilization on a high-intensity exercise test 
      (VO(2) peak), was positively associated with the volumetric enlargement of the 
      hippocampal head, and the CA1 head region specifically. Larger CA1 volumes were 
      also associated with spatial learning on a Virtual Morris Water Maze task and 
      verbal learning on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, but not recall memory. 
      In line with previous animal work, the current findings lend support for the 
      long-axis specialization of the hippocampus in the areas of exercise and learning 
      during adolescence.

TI  - High Mobility Group Box 1 Ameliorates Cognitive Impairment in the 3×Tg-AD Mouse 
      Model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. 
      Studies indicate that neuroinflammation plays an important role in the 
      pathophysiology of AD. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an important 
      chromatin protein. It can be secreted by immune cells and passively released from 
      damaged cells to promote inflammation. HMGB1 also can recruit stem cells and 
      promote their proliferation and tissue repairing. However, the role of HMGB1 in 
      the progression of AD is currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aims were to 
      investigate the effect of HMGB1 on the AD-related pathologies and cognitive 
      function using 3×Tg-AD mouse model. METHODS: Female 5-month-old 3×Tg-AD mice were 
      intracerebroventricularly injected with 4.5 μg of HMGB1 or with saline as a 
      control. The levels of interesting protein were assessed by western blots or 
      immunofluorescence. The effect of HMGB1 on the cognitive function was evaluated 
      by one-trial novel object recognition test and Morris water maze. RESULTS: 
      Intracerebroventricular injection of recombinant HMGB1 ameliorated cognitive 
      impairment in 5-6-month-old 3×Tg-AD mice. The levels of synapsin 1, 
      synaptophysin, MAP2, NeuN, and phosphorylated CREB were increased in 
      HMGB1-treated 3×Tg-AD mouse brains. HMGB1 decreased intracellular amyloid-β level 
      but did not affect tau phosphorylation. HMGB1 treatment also promoted 
      neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and increased the level of GFAP in the 3×Tg-AD 
      mouse brains. CONCLUSION: These results reveal a novel function of HMGB1 in 
      enhancing neuroplasticity and improving cognitive function in 3×Tg-AD mice.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest neurodegenerative disease and, in 
      recent years, studies have increasingly shown that vascular lesions are involved 
      in the pathology of AD onset and progression. Many vascular changes precede the 
      pathological changes and clinical symptoms of AD, and vascular lesions and AD 
      have many common risk factors. Understanding the relationship between vascular 
      factors and the pathological process of AD may help us to identify novel 
      prevention and treatment strategies as well as delay disease progress. Previous 
      studies have shown that lycopene has neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anticancer 
      effects; however, the specific molecular mechanism mediating these effects 
      remains unknown. In the present study, we found: 1) lycopene improved learning 
      and memory in an AD mouse model; 2) lycopene inhibited amyloid plaque aggregation 
      and neuroinflammation; and 3) lycopene induced LXR expression and activated the 
      LXR-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that promotion of 
      neurogenesis and improvement of the functions of the neurovascular unit could be 
      a novel direction for the development of AD therapies.

AB  - Maternal sleep disturbance in pregnancy causes cognitive impairments and 
      emotional disorders in offspring. Microglia-mediated inflammatory processes 
      contribute to prenatal stress-induced neurodevelopmental deficits. Peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) activation underlies the switching 
      of microglial activation phenotypes, which has emerged as a pharmacological 
      target for regulating neuroinflammatory responses in the treatment of 
      neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we investigated the effects of PPARγ-dependent 
      microglial activation on neurogenesis and cognitive behavioral outcomes in male 
      rat offspring exposed to maternal sleep deprivation (MSD) for 72 h from days 
      18-21 of pregnancy. In the Morris water maze test, male MSD rat offspring needed 
      more time than control offspring to escape to the hidden platform and spent less 
      time in the target quadrant when the hidden platform was removed. In MSD rat 
      offspring, microglial density as determined by immunofluorescence was higher, 
      microglia showed fewer and shorter processes, and neurogenesis in the hippocampus 
      was significantly reduced. Levels of mRNA encoding pro-inflammatory markers IL-6, 
      TNFα, and IL-1β were higher in male MSD offspring, whereas levels of 
      anti-inflammatory markers Arg1, IL-4, and IL-10 were lower, as was PPARγ 
      expression in the hippocampus. PPARγ activation by pioglitazone (30 mg/kg/day, 
      i.p., 7 d) mitigated these negative effects of MSD, rescuing hippocampal 
      neurogenesis and improving cognitive function. The PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 
      (1 mg/kg/day, i.p., 7 d) eliminated the effects of pioglitazone. Conditioned 
      medium from pioglitazone-treated microglia promoted proliferation and 
      differentiation of neural progenitor cells. These results suggest that 
      MSD-induced deficits in spatial learning and memory can be ameliorated through 
      PPARγ-dependent modulation of microglial phenotypes.

TI  - WIN55,212-2 Attenuates Cognitive Impairments in AlCl(3) + d-Galactose-Induced 
      Alzheimer's Disease Rats by Enhancing Neurogenesis and Reversing Oxidative 
      Stress.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines9091270 [doi]

AB  - Neurotransmission and cognitive dysfunctions have been linked to old age 
      disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aluminium is a known neurotoxic 
      metal, whereas d-galactose (d-gal) has been established as a senescence agent. 
      WIN55,212-2 (WIN), is a potent cannabinoid agonist which partially restores 
      neurogenesis in aged rats. The current study aimed to explore the therapeutic 
      potentials of WIN on Aluminium chloride (AlCl(3)) and d-gal-induced rat models 
      with cognitive dysfunction. Healthy male albino Wistar rats weighing between 
      200-250 g were injected with d-gal 60 mg/kg intra peritoneally (i.p), while 
      AlCl(3) (200 mg/kg) was orally administered once daily for 10 consecutive weeks. 
      Subsequently, from weeks 8-11 rats were co-administered with WIN (0.5, 1 and 2 
      mg/kg/day) and donepezil 1 mg/kg. The cognitive functions of the rats were 
      assessed with a Morris water maze (MWM). Furthermore, oxidative stress 
      biomarkers; malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) 
      and neurogenesis markers: Nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were 
      also evaluated, as well as the histology of the hippocampus. The results revealed 
      that rats exposed to AlCl(3) and d-gal alone showed cognitive impairments and 
      marked neuronal loss (p < 0.05) in their hippocampal conus ammonis 1 (CA1). 
      Additionally, a significant decrease in the expressions of GFAP and Nestin was 
      also observed, including increased levels of MDA and decreased levels of SOD and 
      GSH. However, administration of WIN irrespective of the doses given reversed the 
      cognitive impairments and the associated biochemical derangements. As there were 
      increases in the levels SOD, GSH, Nestin and GFAP (p < 0.05), while a significant 
      decrease in the levels of MDA was observed, besides attenuation of the aberrant 
      cytoarchitecture of the rat's hippocampi. The biochemical profiles of the 
      WIN-treated rats were normal. Thus, these findings offer possible scientific 
      evidence of WIN being an effective candidate in the treatment of AD-related 
      cognitive deficits.

TI  - Boophone disticha attenuates five day repeated forced swim-induced stress and 
      adult hippocampal neurogenesis impairment in male Balb/c mice.
LID - 10.5115/acb.22.120 [doi]
AB  - Depression is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders and is associated 
      with dysfunction of the neuroendocrine system and alterations in specific brain 
      proteins. Boophone disticha (BD) is an indigenous psychoactive bulb that belongs 
      to the Amaryllidacae family, which is widely used in Southern Africa to treat 
      depression, with scientific evidence of potent antidepressant-like effects. The 
      present study examined the antidepressant effects of BD and its mechanisms of 
      action by measuring some behavioural parameters in the elevated plus maze, brain 
      content of corticosterone, brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), and 
      neuroblast differentiation in the hippocampus of Balb/c mice exposed to the five 
      day repeated forced swim stress (5d-RFSS). Male Balb/c mice were subjected to the 
      5d-RFSS protocol to induce depressive-like behaviour (decreased swimming, 
      increased floating, decreased open arm entry, decreased time spent in the open 
      arms and decreased head dips in the elevated plus maze test) and treated with 
      distilled water, fluoxetine and BD. BD treatment (10 mg/kg/p.o for 3 weeks) 
      significantly attenuated the 5d-RFSS-induced behavioural abnormalities and the 
      elevated serum corticosterone levels observed in stressed mice. Additionally, 
      5d-RFSS exposure significantly decreased the number of neuroblasts in the 
      hippocampus and BDNF levels in the brain of Balb/c mice, while fluoxetine and BD 
      treatment attenuated these changes. The antidepressant effects of BD were 
      comparable to those of fluoxetine, but unlike fluoxetine, BD did not show any 
      anxiogenic effects, suggesting better pharmacological functions. In conclusion, 
      our study shows that BD exerted antidepressant-like effects in 5d-RFSS mice, 
      mediated in part by normalizing brain corticosterone and BDNF levels.

AB  - Dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dBcAMP) is a cell-permeable synthetic 
      analog of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Although the elevation of cAMP 
      levels was reported to promote the functional recovery in spinal cord injury, its 
      role in neurogenesis or functional recovery after hippocampal injury is unknown. 
      The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of dBcAMP on learning, 
      memory, and hippocampal neurogenesis in the excitotoxically lesioned hippocampus. 
      An excitotoxic lesion was induced in the hippocampi of 4-month-old male BALB/c 
      mice by injecting 0.25 μg/μl into the lateral ventricles of both sides. The 
      lesioned mice (L) were divided into L+dBcAMP and L+phosphate-buffered saline 
      (PBS) groups. Sham surgery (S) was done by the injection of 1 μl of sterile 
      saline into the lateral ventricles. The sham surgery mice were divided into 
      S+dBcAMP and S+PBS groups. Mice in the L+dBcAMP and S+dBcAMP groups were treated 
      with dBcAMP for 1 week (i.p., 50 mg/kg), whereas mice in the L+PBS and S+PBS 
      groups were treated with PBS. The mice in all groups were subjected to water maze 
      and passive avoidance tests at the end of the 4th week. Cresyl violet staining 
      and NeuN and doublecortin immunostaining were done to analyze the morphology and 
      neurogenesis. The water maze learning sessions did not show a significant 
      difference in escape latency between the groups, suggesting an unimpaired 
      learning ability of mice in all groups. The L+dBcAMP mice had significantly short 
      entry latency and higher target quadrant time/distance traveled compared to the 
      L+PBS group, suggesting better memory retention. The L+dBcAMP group had a 
      significantly improved memory retention compared to the L+PBS mice during the 
      passive avoidance test. Morphological studies showed significantly greater adult 
      neurons and increased hippocampal neurogenesis in the hippocampus of mice in the 
      L+dBcAMP group compared to those in the L+PBS group. There was no significant 
      difference between the S+dBcAMP and S+PBS groups in the water maze/passive 
      avoidance tests and the number of neurons. In conclusion, dBcAMP protects the 
      hippocampal neuron from degeneration and enhances hippocampal neurogenesis, 
      learning, and memory.

TI  - Fingolimod ameliorates schizophrenia-like cognitive impairments induced by 
      phencyclidine in male rats.
PG  - 161-173
LID - 10.1111/bph.15954 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Improvement of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia 
      remains an unmet need owing to the lack of new therapies and drugs. Recent 
      studies have reported that fingolimod, an immunomodulatory drug for treating 
      multiple sclerosis, demonstrates anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in 
      several neurological disease models. This suggests its usefulness for 
      ameliorating cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Herein, we assessed the 
      efficacy profile and mechanism of fingolimod in a rat model of phencyclidine 
      (PCP)-induced schizophrenia. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were 
      treated with PCP for 14 days. The therapeutic effect of fingolimod on cognitive 
      function was assessed using the Morris water maze and fear conditioning tests. 
      Hippocampal neurogenesis and the expression of astrocytes and microglia were 
      evaluated using immunostaining. Cytokine expression was quantified using 
      multiplexed flow cytometry. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and 
      phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase were determined using 
      western blot analysis. KEY RESULTS: Fingolimod attenuated cognitive deficits and 
      restored hippocampal neurogenesis in a dose-dependent manner in PCP-treated rats. 
      Fingolimod treatment exerted anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting microglial 
      activation and IL-6 and IL-1β pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. The 
      underlying mechanism involves the upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor protein expression and activation of the ERK signalling pathway. 
      CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This is the first preclinical assessment of the 
      effects of fingolimod on cognitive function in a model for schizophrenia. Our 
      results suggest the immune system plays an crucial role in cognitive alterations 
      in schizophrenia and highlight the potential of immunomodulatory strategies to 
      improve cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the effects of postnatal low-concentration arsenic 
      exposure on learning, social skills and frontal cortex neurogenesis in rats. 
      Water-based arsenic exposure rat models were established on postnatal days 4-10 
      (P4-P10). The experimental animals were divided into four groups: the control 
      group, a 15 μg/L As(2)O(3) water group, a 30 μg/L As(2)O(3) water group, and a 
      45 μg/L As(2)O(3) water group. Cognitive function was examined with the Morris 
      water maze, anxiety-like behavior with the open field test and light-dark box 
      test, and social skills with a social interaction test. The frontal cortices of 
      pups from each experimental group were sectioned at various time points after 
      arsenic exposure. The morphologies and neurogenesis of the neurons in the frontal 
      cortices were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining, Nissl staining, and 
      doublecortin (DCX) immunostaining. Significant positive correlations between 
      arsenic concentration and deficits in learning and social skills were found, and 
      the arsenic exposure groups showed significant increases in anxiety-like behavior 
      compared with the control group (all Ps<0.05). Abnormal morphologic changes in 
      the external granular layer and external pyramidal layer were positively 
      correlated with the water arsenic concentration in the acute phase of arsenic 
      exposure. However, at five weeks after arsenic exposure, the frontal cortex 
      morphology was restored. Moreover, immunohistochemistry revealed that compared to 
      the control group, the groups that were exposed to arsenic exhibited 
      significantly higher levels of DCX expression in the external granular and 
      external pyramidal layers (all Ps<0.001). Furthermore, the 30 μg/L and 45 μg/L 
      arsenic exposure groups still showed some DCX expression at five weeks after 
      exposure. In conclusion, postnatal low-concentration arsenic exposure impaired 
      learning and social skills and increased anxiety-like behaviors, and abnormal 
      frontal cortex neurogenesis may be the mechanism underlying these effects.

TI  - EphB2 Deficiency Induces Depression-Like Behaviors and Memory Impairment: 
      Involvement of NMDA 2B Receptor Dependent Signaling.
PG  - 862

AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2 mediates development of the neurogenic niche of 
      excitatory neurons, suggesting the possibility that its inactivation plays a role 
      in neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and memory impairment. While 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is involved in regulating memory formation 
      and neurogenesis in adult animal, it remains unclear how NMDA receptor subtypes 
      mediate depression and cognitive deficits caused by EphB2 loss. The present study 
      shows that EphB2 inactivation results in depression-like behaviors, memory 
      impairment and defects of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Compared to wild-type 
      littermates, EphB2 KO mice exhibited depression-like behavior and deficits in 
      spatial memory and cognition in forced swimming, tail suspension, Morris water 
      maze, object recognition test and object location test. These behavioral 
      abnormalities were accompanied by substantial decreases in the number of BrdU+ 
      progenitor neurons, phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein 
      (pCREB) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and increased NMDA receptor 
      2B (NR2B) expression. These molecular, cellular and behavioral alterations 
      induced by EphB2 inactivation were reversed by NR2B antagonist Ro25-6981, 
      suggesting that EphB2 functions to prevent the progression of depression-like 
      behavior and memory impairment by downregulating NR2B. Our findings highlight 
      that NR2B is responsible for EphB2-dependent behavioral and morphological 
      changes. EphB2 may thus be as an important candidate target for treating 
      psychiatric and cognitive disorders.

TI  - Curcumin Alleviates Chronic Pain and Improves Cognitive Impairment via Enhancing 
      Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Sciatic Nerve Constriction Rats.
PG  - 1061-1070
LID - 10.2147/JPR.S299604 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cognitive impairment is a complication that most frequently happens in 
      patients with chronic neuropathic pain and has limited effective therapy. The aim 
      of this study was to explore the effects of curcumin on the cognitive deficit in 
      rats with peripheral nerve injury induced-neuropathic pain. METHODS: The 
      neuropathic pain rat model was constructed using chronic constriction injury 
      (CCI). The curcumin (60 mg/kg) or vehicle was intraperitoneally administered once 
      a day, beginning at 14th day after surgery and continued for 14 consecutive days. 
      The nociceptive threshold tests were measured by paw mechanical withdraw 
      threshold (PMWT) and paw thermal withdrawal latency (PTWL), while the spatial 
      memory abilities were evaluated by the Morris water maze test. The mean counts of 
      bromodeoxyuridine (Brdu)/neuronal nuclei (NeuN) as well as Brdu/doublecortin 
      (DCX) co-labeled cells were used to evaluate neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of 
      hippocampus. The ultrastructure of the synapse in hippocampal region was 
      visualized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: Increased PMWT 
      and PTWL, as well as relieved memory deficits, were found in CCI rats under 
      curcumin administration. Moreover, curcumin treatment increased the number of 
      newly born immature (BrdU/NeuN) and newly generated mature neurons (BrdU/DCX). 
      The TEM examination revealed increased PSD thickness and shorter active zone 
      length as well as narrowed synaptic cleft width in the hippocampal region of CCI 
      rats after curcumin injection. CONCLUSION: Curcumin can alleviate CCI induced 
      nociceptive behaviors and memory deficit. This effect might be associated with 
      hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity improvements, which indicated 
      curcumin as a potential strategy for the cognitive impairment restoration under 
      prolonged neuropathic pain condition.

      Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated as a key player in the pathogenesis 
      of Parkinson's disease (PD). The MitoPark mouse, a transgenic mitochondrial 
      impairment model developed by specific inactivation of TFAM in dopaminergic 
      neurons, spontaneously exhibits progressive motor deficits and neurodegeneration, 
      recapitulating several features of PD. Since nonmotor symptoms are now recognized 
      as important features of the prodromal stage of PD, we comprehensively assessed 
      the clinically relevant motor and nonmotor deficiencies from ages 8-24 wk in both 
      male and female MitoPark mice and their littermate controls. As expected, motor 
      deficits in MitoPark mice began around 12-14 wk and became severe by 16-24 wk. 
      Interestingly, MitoPark mice exhibited olfactory deficits in the novel and social 
      scent tests as early as 10-12 wk as compared to age-matched littermate controls. 
      Additionally, male MitoPark mice showed spatial memory deficits before female 
      mice, beginning at 8 wk and becoming most severe at 16 wk, as determined by the 
      Morris water maze. MitoPark mice between 16 and 24 wk spent more time immobile in 
      forced swim and tail suspension tests, and made fewer entries into open arms of 
      the elevated plus maze, indicating a depressive and anxiety-like phenotype, 
      respectively. Importantly, depressive behavior as determined by immobility in 
      forced swim test was reversible by antidepressant treatment with desipramine. 
      Neurochemical and mechanistic studies revealed significant changes in CREB 
      phosphorylation, BDNF, and catecholamine levels as well as neurogenesis in key 
      brain regions. Collectively, our results indicate that MitoPark mice 
      progressively exhibit deficits in olfactory discrimination, cognitive learning 
      and memory, and anxiety- and depression-like behaviors as well as key 
      neurochemical signaling associated with nonmotor deficits in PD. Thus, MitoPark 
      mice can serve as an invaluable model for studying nonmotor deficits in addition 
      to studying the motor deficits related to pathology in PD.

TI  - Regulation of Genes Related to Cognition after tDCS in an Intermittent Hypoxic 
      Brain Injury Rat Model.
LID - 10.3390/genes13101824 [doi]
LID - 1824
AB  - Background: Hypoxic brain injury is a condition caused by restricted oxygen 
      supply to the brain. Several studies have reported cognitive decline, 
      particularly in spatial memory, after exposure to intermittent hypoxia (IH). 
      However, the effect and mechanism of action of IH exposure on cognition have not 
      been evaluated by analyzing gene expression after transcranial direct current 
      stimulation (tDCS). Hence, the purpose of this study was to investigate the 
      effects of tDCS on gene regulation and cognition in a rat model of IH-induced 
      brain injury. Methods: Twenty-four 10-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were 
      divided into two groups: IH exposed rats with no stimulation and IH-exposed rats 
      that received tDCS. All rats were exposed to a hypoxic chamber containing 10% 
      oxygen for twelve hours a day for five days. The stimulation group received tDCS 
      at an intensity of 200 µA over the frontal bregma areas for 30 min each day for a 
      week. As a behavior test, the escape latency on the Morris water maze (MWM) test 
      was measured to assess spatial memory before and after stimulation. After seven 
      days of stimulation, gene microarray analysis was conducted with a KEGG mapper 
      tool. Results: Although there were no significant differences between the groups 
      before and after stimulation, there was a significant effect of time and a 
      significant time × group interaction on escape latency. In the microarray 
      analysis, significant fold changes in 12 genes related to neurogenesis were found 
      in the stimulation group after tDCS (p &lt; 0.05, fold change &gt; 2 times, the 
      average of the normalized read count (RC) &gt; 6 times). The highly upregulated 
      genes in the stimulation group after tDCS were SOS, Raf, PI3K, Rac1, IRAK, and 
      Bax. The highly downregulated genes in the stimulation group after tDCS were CHK, 
      Crk, Rap1, p38, Ras, and NF-kB. Conclusion: In this study, we confirmed that SOS, 
      Raf, PI3K, Rac1, IRAK, and Bax were upregulated and that CHK, Crk, Rap1, p38, 
      Ras, and NF-kB were downregulated in a rat model of IH-induced brain injury after 
      application of tDCS.

AB  - Early life stress usually causes the abnormal brain development and results in 
      the onset of cognitive and emotional disorders in later childhood. Neonatal 
      hypoxic ischemia (HI) causes dramatic brain damage in early life and resulted in 
      serious impairment to brain development. Hippocampal neurogenesis, as one of the 
      key structural plasticity to mediate animal behaviors, can be impact by neonatal 
      HI until child stage. In our study, we identified the natural product resveratrol 
      (RES) as the potential alternative therapy to improve brain functions of 
      childhood mice after underwent neonatal HI. Treatment of RES improved the spatial 
      learning and memory in morris water maze and increased the recognize ability in 
      objective recognition task. Moreover, RES also attenuate the depressive and 
      anxiety like mood in child mice after experiencing neonatal HI. Brain 
      morphological study showed RES promote the proliferation of neural stem cells and 
      increase the neuronal differentiation in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) region. 
      Our in vitro study in C17.2 neural stem cell line demonstrated RES could prevent 
      the mitochondrial fragmentation induced by hypoxia. Moreover, same effect was 
      also observed in primary cultural neurons. To summarize, RES could prevent the 
      cognitive deficit and depressive/anxiety mood in childhood with experience of 
      neonatal HI via promoting hippocampal neurogenesis. Improving mitochondrial 
      dynamics could be one of the key biological mechanisms underlying such effects of 
      RES.

TI  - The Free Radical Scavenger N-Tert-Butyl-α-Phenylnitrone (PBN) Administered to 
      Immature Rats During Status Epilepticus Alters Neurogenesis and Has Variable 
      Effects, Both Beneficial and Detrimental, on Long-Term Outcomes.

AB  - Status epilepticus (SE), especially in immature animals, is known to produce 
      recurrent spontaneous seizures and behavioral comorbidities later in life. The 
      cause of these adverse long-term outcomes is unknown, but it has been 
      hypothesized that free radicals produced by SE may play a role. We tested this 
      hypothesis by treating immature (P25) rats with the free radical scavenger 
      N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN) at the time of lithium chloride 
      (LiCl)/pilocarpine (PILO)-induced SE. Later, long-term outcomes were assessed. 
      Cognitive impairment (spatial memory) was tested in the Morris water maze (MWM). 
      Emotional disturbances were assessed by the capture test (aggressiveness) and 
      elevated plus maze's (EPM) test (anxiety). Next, the presence and severity of 
      spontaneous seizures were assessed by continuous video/EEG monitoring for 5 days. 
      Finally, immunochemistry, stereology and morphology were used to assess the 
      effects of PBN on hippocampal neuropathology and neurogenesis. PBN treatment 
      modified the long-term effects of SE in varying ways, some beneficial and some 
      detrimental. Beneficially, PBN protected against severe anatomical damage in the 
      hippocampus and associated spatial memory impairment. Detrimentally, PBN treated 
      animals had more severe seizures later in life. PBN also made animals more 
      aggressive and more anxious. Correlating with these detrimental long-term 
      outcomes, PBN significantly modified post-natal neurogenesis. Treated animals had 
      significantly increased numbers of mature granule cells (GCs) ectopically located 
      in the dentate hilus (DH). These results raise the possibility that abnormal 
      neurogenesis may significantly contribute to the development of post-SE epilepsy 
      and behavioral comorbidities.

AB  - Mechanisms underlying the protective effect of exercise training against the 
      progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not fully understood. This study 
      investigated the effects of treadmill running on Aβ plaque burden and 
      hyper-phosphorylated tau protein, neuro-inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, 
      and adult neurogenesis markers in conjunction with cognitive impairments in 
      triple transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice. At age of three months, the 3xTg-AD mice 
      were assigned to control (AD, n = 10) or exercise training (AD-EXE, n = 10). The 
      AD-EXE mice were trained on a rodent motor-driven treadmill with a frequency of 5 
      days per week for 12 weeks. As a consequence, AD-EXE mice had lower levels of Aβ 
      plaque burden and neuro-inflammation, positive changes in mitochondrial function 
      toward a more robust phenotype, and increases in hippocampal adult neurogenesis 
      markers in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex compared to AD mice. The 
      alleviating effects of treadmill running against the progression of the disease 
      were accompanied by enhanced AD-like cognitive performances based on Morris water 
      maze. The current findings support and extend previous studies reporting the 
      protective effect of physical exercise against the progression of the disease in 
      AD animal models.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating cerebrovascular 
      disease that leads to poor outcomes. Neurogenesis, an essential recovery 
      mechanism after brain injury, has not been fully elucidated after SAH. METHODS: A 
      total of 122 SD rats were used in this study. For experiment one, the rats were 
      randomly divided into six groups: sham and SAH with different time points 
      (1,3,5,7,14 days) (n = 12/group). An endovascular perforation method was 
      conducted for SAH model. Rats were injected with 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 
      50 mg/kg) 24 h before euthanasia at different time points after SAH. The BrdU 
      labeled cells were detected by immunohistochemistry; Doublecortin (DCX) and glial 
      fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured by western blot and 
      immunohistochemistry. For experiment two, rats were randomly divided into five 
      groups: sham and SAH with different time points (1, 2, 4, 8 weeks) (n = 6/group). 
      Rats received BrdU (50 mg/kg) once daily for 7 days after the induction of SAH. 
      Double immunofluorescence staining was used to verify proliferation, 
      differentiation and migration of progenitor cells. Rotarod test and water maze 
      used to test the neurobehavioral recovery. RESULTS: Our results showed that BrdU 
      positive cells in hippocampus changed overtime after SAH. BrdU positive cells 
      decreased as early as 1 day reaching lowest levels at 3 days after SAH, after 
      which it gradually recovered. Similar change patterns were observed with DCX, 
      which was reversed with GFAP. In addition, BrdU did not co-localize with cleaved 
      caspase-3. The BrdU positive cells mainly differentiated into immature neurons 
      for short-term fate, whereas they differentiated into mature neurons for 
      long-term fate but not astrocytes, which facilitated neurobehavioral recovery 
      after SAH. CONCLUSION: Neurogenesis in the hippocampus changes overtime after 
      SAH. The neuronal progenitor cells may play an essential role in the 
      neurobehavioral recovery after brain injury induced by SAH, since short-term 
      progenitors helped with the recovery of immature neurons in the hippocampus, 
      whereas long-term progenitors differentiated into mature neurons.

AB  - Neurogenesis might influence oligodendrogenesis and selectively instruct 
      myelination in the mammalian brain. Running exercise could induce neurogenesis 
      and protect the myelin sheaths in the dentate gyrus of AD mice. It is unclear 
      whether running exercise can protect myelin sheaths in the absence of 
      neurogenesis in the hippocampus of AD mice. Six-month-old male APP/PS1 transgenic 
      mice were randomly assigned to a control group (Tg control) or a running group 
      (Tg runner), and age-matched non-transgenic littermates were used as a wild-type 
      group (WT control). The Tg runner mice were subjected to a running protocol for 
      four months. The behaviors of the mice in the three groups were then assessed 
      using the Morris water maze, and related quantitative parameters of the myelin 
      sheaths within the CA1 field were investigated using unbiased stereological and 
      electron microscopy techniques. Learning and spatial memory performance, CA1 
      volume, the volumes of the myelinated fibers, and myelin sheaths in the CA1 field 
      were all significantly worse in the Tg control mice than in the WT control mice. 
      Learning and spatial memory performance, CA1 volume and the volume of the myelin 
      sheaths in the CA1 field were all significantly greater in the Tg runner mice 
      than in the Tg control mice. These results reveal demyelinating lesions in the 
      CA1 field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice and indicate that running exercise 
      could protect against myelin sheath degeneration in the absence of neurogenesis, 
      thereby reducing CA1 atrophy and delaying the onset and progression of AD.

TI  - The Cyanthin Diterpenoid and Sesterterpene Constituents of Hericium erinaceus 
      Mycelium Ameliorate Alzheimer's Disease-Related Pathologies in APP/PS1 Transgenic 
      Mice.
LID - 10.3390/ijms19020598 [doi]
LID - 598
AB  - Hericium erinaceus was used in traditional Chinese medicine for physiologically 
      beneficial medicines. Recently, it has become a candidate in causing positive 
      brain health-related activities. We previously reported that Hericium erinaceus 
      mycelium ameliorates Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathologies. To reveal the 
      role of the cyanthin diterpenoid and sesterterpene constituents on this effects, 
      erinacine A and S were isolated and their effects on attenuating AD-related 
      pathology in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice were investigated. A 30 day short-term 
      administration of erinacine A and S were performed to explore the effect of each 
      erinacine on AD-related pathology including amyloid β production and degradation, 
      plaque formation, plaque growth, glial activation and neurogenesis deterioration. 
      Our results indicated the benefit effects of both erinacine A and S in cerebrum 
      of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, including: (1) attenuating cerebral plaque loading by 
      inhibiting plaque growth; (2) diminishing the activation of glial cells; (3) 
      raising the level of insulin degrading enzyme; and (4) promoting hippocampal 
      neurogenesis. Moreover, erinacine A reduced the level of insoluble amyloid β and 
      C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein which was not mediated by 
      erinacine S. We further performed a long term administration of erinacine A and 
      found that erinacine A recovered the impairment in the tasks including burrowing, 
      nesting, and Morris water maze. Our data pointed out that although both erinacine 
      A and S reduce AD pathology via reducing amyloid deposition and promoting 
      neurogenesis, erinacine A can also inhibit amyloid β production and is worth to 
      be further developed for AD therapeutic use.

AB  - The central nervous system is vulnerable to chronic alcohol abuse, and alcohol 
      dependence is a chronically relapsing disorder which causes a variety of physical 
      and mental disorders. Appropriate animal models are important for investigating 
      the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. The crossed High Alcohol 
      Preferring mice prefer alcohol to water when given free access. In the present 
      study, we used female cHAP mice as a model of chronic voluntary drinking to 
      evaluate the effects of alcohol on neurobehavioral and neuropathological changes. 
      The female cHAP mice had free-choice access to 10% ethanol and water, while 
      control mice had access to water alone at the age of 60-day-old. The mice were 
      exposed to alcohol for 7 months then subjected to neurobehavioral tests including 
      open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM), and Morris water maze (MWM). Results 
      from OF and EPM tests suggested that chronic voluntary drinking caused 
      anxiety-like behaviors. After behavior tests, mice were sacrificed, and brain 
      tissues were processed for biochemical analyses. Alcohol altered the levels of 
      several neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors in the brain including 
      gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), corticotropin-releasing factor, cAMP response 
      element-binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Alcohol 
      increased the expression of neuroinflammation markers including interleukin-6 
      (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 
      (MCP-1) and C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2). Alcohol also induced cleaved 
      caspase-3 and glial fibrillary acidic protein, indicative of neurodegeneration 
      and gliosis. In addition, alcohol inhibited the expression of thiamine 
      transporters in the brain and reduced thiamine levels in the blood. Alcohol also 
      caused oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and stimulated 
      neurogenesis.

TI  - Impaired Cognitive Function and Altered Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity in Mice 
      Lacking Dermatan Sulfotransferase Chst14/D4st1.
PG  - 26
LID - 10.3389/fnmol.2019.00026 [doi]
LID - 26
AB  - Chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) proteoglycans (PGs) are major 
      extracellular matrix (ECM) components of the central nervous system (CNS). A 
      large body of evidence has shown that CSPGs/DSPGs play critical roles in neuronal 
      growth, axon guidance, and plasticity in the developing and mature CNS. It has 
      been proposed that these PGs exert their function through specific interaction of 
      CS/DS chains with its binding partners in a manner that depends on the sulfation 
      patterns of CS/DS. It has been reported that dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 
      (Chst14/D4st1) specific for DS, but not chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 
      (Chst11/C4st1) specific for CS, regulates proliferation and neurogenesis of 
      neural stem cells (NSCs), indicating that CS and DS play distinct roles in the 
      self-renewal and differentiation of NSCs. However, it remains unknown whether 
      specific sulfation profiles of DS has any effect on CNS plasticity. In the 
      present study, Chst14/D4st1-deficient (Chst14 (-/-)) mice was employed to 
      investigate the involvement of DS in synaptic plasticity. First, behavior study 
      using Morris Water Maze (MWM) showed that the spatial learning and memory of 
      Chst14 (-/-) mice was impaired when compared to their wild type (WT) littermates. 
      Corroborating the behavior result, long-term potentiation (LTP) at the 
      hippocampal CA3-CA1 connection was reduced in Chst14 (-/-) mice compared to the 
      WT mice. Finally, the protein levels of N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, 
      α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor, 
      postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95), growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43), 
      synaptophysin (SYN) and N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF) which are 
      important in synaptic plasticity were examined and Chst14/D4st1 deficiency was 
      shown to significantly reduce the expression of these proteins in the 
      hippocampus. Further studies revealed that Akt/mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) 
      pathway proteins, including protein kinase B (p-Akt), p-mTOR and p-S6, were 
      significantly lower in Chst14 (-/-) mice, which might contribute to the decreased 
      protein expression. Together, this study reveals that specific sulfation of DS is 
      critical in synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus and learning and memory, which 
      might be associated with the changes in the expression of glutamate receptors and 
      other synaptic proteins though Akt/mTOR pathway.

TI  - Intermittent hypoxic conditioning restores neurological dysfunction of mice 
      induced by long-term hypoxia.
PG  - 202-215
LID - 10.1111/cns.13996 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Central nervous system diseases are associated with hypoxia, which 
      usually cause irreversible nerve damage, but the underlying mechanism is unclear 
      and effective intervention strategies are lacking. This study was designed to 
      explore the mechanism and treatment strategy of hypoxia-induced nerve injury. 
      METHODS: In this study, 13% O(2) was used to treat mice for 0, 1, 3 7, and 
      14 days, Morris water maze and other animal behavior experiments were used to 
      evaluate the neurological function of mice. TUNEL, BrdU, PCNA, DCX, and SOX2 
      staining were used to observe the apoptosis and proliferation of mouse neurons. 
      RT-PCR and Iba1 staining were used to evaluate the release of inflammatory 
      factors IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α and the activation of microglia. RESULTS: 
      Short-term hypoxia promotes neurogenesis, while long-term hypoxia inhibits 
      neurogenesis. The changes in hypoxia-induced neurogenesis were positively 
      correlated with neurological functions, but negatively correlated with apoptosis. 
      Moreover, intermittent hypoxic conditioning restored long-term hypoxia-induced 
      neurological dysfunction by promoting neural stem cell generation and inhibiting 
      the release of inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α and the activation of 
      microglia. CONCLUSION: Hypoxia promoted neurogenesis in a time-dependent manner, 
      and intermittent hypoxic conditioning exerted a neuroprotective effect through 
      promoting neural stem cell generation and suppressing inflammation induced by 
      long-term hypoxia stress, which provided a novel concept to develop a treatment 
      for hypoxia-related brain injury.

TI  - MiR-17-92 Cluster-Enriched Exosomes Derived from Human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal 
      Stromal Cells Improve Tissue and Functional Recovery in Rats after Traumatic 
      Brain Injury.
PG  - 1535-1550

AB  - Exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication by delivering 
      microribonucleic acids (miRNAs) to recipient cells. Previous studies have 
      demonstrated that multi-potent mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived exosomes 
      improve functional recovery after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI). This 
      study was performed to determine efficacy of miR-17-92 cluster-enriched exosomes 
      (Exo-17-92) harvested from human bone marrow MSCs transfected with a miR-17-92 
      cluster plasmid in enhancing tissue and neurological recovery compared with 
      exosomes derived from MSCs transfected with an empty plasmid vector (Exo-empty) 
      for treatment of TBI. Adult male rats underwent a unilateral moderate cortical 
      contusion. Animals received a single intravenous injection of miR-17-92 
      cluster-enriched exosomes (100 μg/rat, approximately 3.75x10(11) particles, 
      Exo-17-92) or control exosomes (100 μg/rat, Exo-empty) or Vehicle 
      (phosphate-buffered solution) one day after injury. A battery of neurological 
      functional tests was performed weekly after TBI for five weeks. Spatial learning 
      and memory were measured on days 31-35 after TBI using the Morris water maze 
      test. All animals were sacrificed five weeks after injury. Their brains were 
      processed for histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of lesion 
      volume, cell loss, angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and neuroinflammation. Compared 
      with Vehicle, both Exo-17-92 and Exo-empty treatments significantly improved 
      sensorimotor and cognitive function, reduced neuroinflammation and hippocampal 
      neuronal cell loss, promoted angiogenesis and neurogenesis without altering the 
      lesion volume. Moreover, Exo-17-92 treatment exhibited a significantly more 
      robust therapeutic effect on improvement in functional recovery by reducing 
      neuroinflammation and cell loss, enhancing angiogenesis and neurogenesis than did 
      Exo-empty treatment. Exosomes enriched with miR-17-92 cluster have a 
      significantly better effect on improving functional recovery after TBI compared 
      with Exo-empty, likely by reducing neuroinflammation and enhancing endogenous 
      angiogenesis and neurogenesis. Engineering specific miRNA in exosomes may provide 
      a novel therapeutic strategy for management of unilateral moderate cortical 
      contusion TBI.

      Mitigation Following Global Cerebral Ischemia.
PG  - 731855

AB  - Our recent study revealed that photobiomodulation (PBM) inhibits delayed neuronal 
      death by preserving mitochondrial dynamics and function following global cerebral 
      ischemia (GCI). In the current study, we clarified whether PBM exerts effective 
      roles in endogenous neurogenesis and long-lasting neurological recovery after 
      GCI. Adult male rats were treated with 808 nm PBM at 20 mW/cm(2) irradiance for 2 
      min on cerebral cortex surface (irradiance ∼7.0 mW/cm(2), fluence ∼0.8 J/cm(2) on 
      the hippocampus) beginning 3 days after GCI for five consecutive days. Cognitive 
      function was evaluated using the Morris water maze. Neural stem cell (NSC) 
      proliferation, immature neurons, and mature neurons were examined using 
      bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-, doublecortin (DCX)-, and NeuN-staining, respectively. 
      Protein expression, such as NLRP3, cleaved IL1β, GFAP, and Iba1 was detected 
      using immunofluorescence staining, and ultrastructure of astrocyte and microglia 
      was observed by transmission electron microscopy. The results revealed that PBM 
      exerted a markedly neuroprotective role and improved spatial learning and memory 
      ability at 58 days of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) but not at 7 days of 
      reperfusion. Mechanistic studies revealed that PBM suppressed reactive astrocytes 
      and maintained astrocyte regeneration at 7 days of reperfusion, as well as 
      elevated neurogenesis at 58 days of reperfusion, as evidenced by a significant 
      decrease in the fluorescence intensity of GFAP (astrocyte marker) but unchanged 
      the number of BrdU-GFAP colabeled cells at the early timepoint, and a robust 
      elevation in the number of DCX-NeuN colabeled cells at the later timepoint in the 
      PBM-treated group compared to the GCI group. Notably, PBM treatment protected the 
      ultrastructure of astrocyte and microglia cells at 58 days but not 7 days of 
      reperfusion in the hippocampal CA1 region. Furthermore, PBM treatment 
      significantly attenuated the GCI-induced immunofluorescence intensity of NLRP3 
      (an inflammasome component), cleaved IL1β (reflecting inflammasome activation) 
      and Iba1, as well as the colocalization of NLRP3/GFAP or cleaved IL-1β/GFAP, 
      especially in animals subjected to I/R at 58 days. Taken together, PBM treatment 
      performed postischemia exerted a long-lasting protective effect on astrocytes and 
      promoted endogenous neurogenesis in the hippocampal CA1 region, which might 
      contribute to neurological recovery after GCI.

AB  - The diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) in ever younger children led us to 
      question the impact of insulin deficiency or chronic hyperglycemia on cerebral 
      development and memory performances. Here, we sought abnormalities in these 
      traits in a model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in juvenile rats treated or 
      not by insulin. We made the assumption that such alterations would be related, at 
      least in part, to excessive glucocorticoid exposition in hippocampal neurons. We 
      have compared 3 groups of juvenile rats: controls, untreated diabetics and 
      insulin-treated diabetics. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (65 mg/kg 
      IP/day, 2 consecutive days), at postnatal days 21 and 22 and a subcutaneous 
      pellet delivering 2 U of insulin/day was implanted in treated diabetic rats 
      3 days later. Three weeks after diabetes induction, cognitive performances (Y 
      maze, object location and recognition tests), in vivo brain structure (brain 
      volume and water diffusion by structural magnetic resonance imaging), and 
      hippocampal neurogenesis (immunohistochemical labeling) measurements were 
      undertaken. Corticosterone levels were evaluated in plasma under basal and stress 
      conditions, and within hippocampus together with 11β-dehydrocorticosterone to 
      assess 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) activity. The 
      comparison of the three experimental groups revealed that, compared to controls, 
      untreated diabetic rats showed decreased cognitive performances in Y-maze and 
      object location test (p < 0.05), decreased brain and hippocampal microstructure 
      (p < 0.05), and decreased maturation and survival of hippocampal newborn neurons 
      (p < 0.05). These alterations were associated with increased plasma 
      corticosterone at the baseline nadir of its secretion (p < 0.001) and during the 
      recovery phase following a restraint stress (p < 0.001), as well as increased 
      hippocampal corticosterone levels (p < 0.01) and 11β-HSD1 activity (p < 0.05). As 
      untreated diabetic rats, insulin-treated diabetic rats displayed decreased brain 
      volume and water diffusion (p < 0.05 compared to controls) and intermediate 
      memory performances and hippocampal neurogenesis (p value not significant 
      compared to either controls or untreated diabetics). Moreover, they were similar 
      to controls for basal plasma and hippocampal corticosterone and 11β-HSD1 activity 
      but show increased plasma corticosterone during the recovery phase following a 
      restraint stress similar to untreated diabetics (p < 0.001 compared to controls). 
      Thus, insulin did not completely prevent several hippocampal-dependent behavioral 
      and structural alterations induced by diabetes in juvenile rats which may relate 
      to the higher cognitive difficulties encountered in T1D children compared to 
      non-diabetic controls. Although insulin restored basal corticosterone and 
      11β-HSD1 activity (in hippocampus and plasma), the negative feedback regulation

TI  - Lactobacillus johnsonii BS15 improves intestinal environment against 
      fluoride-induced memory impairment in mice-a study based on the gut-brain axis 
      hypothesis.
PG  - e10125
LID - 10.7717/peerj.10125 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Excessive fluoride can lead to chronic neurodegeneration 
      characterized by neuron and myelin loss and memory dysfunction. The gut-brain 
      axis hypothesis suggests that gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating 
      brain function. Thus, using probiotics to adjust the gut microenvironment may be 
      a potential therapy for mental diseases. METHODS: Mice in the prob group were 
      administrated with Lactobacillus johnsonii BS15 for 28 days prior to and 
      throughout a 70-day exposure to sodium fluoride. The drinking water of all groups 
      (F and prob groups) except the control group were replaced by high-fluoride water 
      (100 mg NaF/L) on day 28. Animals in each group were divided into two subsets: 
      one underwent behavioral test, and the other was sacrificed for sampling. The 
      mRNA expression level and protein content related to inflammatory reaction in the 
      ileum and hippocampus were respectively detected by reverse transcription 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA). The mRNA expression levels of proteins related to myelin 
      structure, apoptosis, and memory in the hippocampus and tight junction proteins 
      in the ileum were determined by RT-qPCR and/or immunohistochemistry. Gut 
      permeability markers (D-lactate and diamine oxidase (DAO)) in the serum were also 
      examined by ELISA. RESULTS: The results showed that fluoride exposure induced a 
      lower spontaneous exploration (P < 0.05) in T-maze test, which indicated an 
      impairment of memory. Spontaneous exploration of BS15-treated mice was 
      significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that in F group. Fluoride reduced (P < 0.05) 
      levels of myelin structural protein (proteolipid protein) and 
      neurogenesis-associated proteins (brain-derived neurotrophic factor and 
      cAMP/Ca(2+) responsive element-binding protein), induced disordered inflammatory 
      cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6; P < 0.05), increased pro-apoptotic genes 
      (caspase-3; P < 0.05), and decreased anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2; P < 0.05) in 
      the hippocampus, of which the influences were reversed by BS15. BS15 treatment 
      exerted significant preventive effects on reversing the gut inflammation induced 
      by excessive fluoride intake by reducing (P < 0.05) the levels of 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and 
      interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)) and remarkably increasing (P < 0.05) the level of 
      anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10). Moreover, the serum DAO activity and 
      D-lactate concentration significantly increased by fluoride were also reduced (P 
      < 0.05) by BS15. This result indicated the profitable effect of BS15 on gut 
      permeability. CONCLUSION: L. johnsonii BS15 intake could benefit the 
      neuroinflammation and demyelination in the hippocampus by improving the gut 
      environment and ameliorating fluorine-induced memory dysfunction.

TI  - A Preclinical Model of Computerized Cognitive Training: Touchscreen Cognitive 
      Testing Enhances Cognition and Hippocampal Cellular Plasticity in Wildtype and 
      Alzheimer's Disease Mice.
PG  - 766745

AB  - With the growing popularity of touchscreen cognitive testing in rodents, it is 
      imperative to understand the fundamental effects exposure to this paradigm can 
      have on the animals involved. In this study, we set out to assess 
      hippocampal-dependant learning in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) on two highly translatable touchscreen tasks - the Paired Associate Learning 
      (PAL) task and the Trial Unique Non-Matching to Location (TUNL) task. Both of 
      these tests are based on human tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test 
      Automated Battery (CANTAB) and are sensitive to deficits in both mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) and AD. Mice were assessed for deficits in PAL at 9-12 months of 
      age, then on TUNL at 8-11 and 13-16 months. No cognitive deficits were evident in 
      APP/PS1 mice at any age, contrary to previous reports using maze-based learning 
      and memory tasks. We hypothesized that daily and long-term touchscreen training 
      may have inadvertently acted as a cognitive enhancer. When touchscreen-tested 
      mice were assessed on the Morris water maze, they showed improved task 
      acquisition compared to naïve APP/PS1 mice and wild-type (WT) littermate 
      controls. In addition, we show that touchscreen-trained WT and APP/PS1 mice show 
      increased cell proliferation and immature neuron numbers in the dentate gyrus 
      compared to behaviorally naïve WT and APP/PS1 mice. This result indicates that 
      the touchscreen testing paradigm could improve cognitive performance, and/or mask 
      an impairment, in experimental mouse models. This touchscreen-induced cognitive 
      enhancement may involve increased neurogenesis, and possibly other forms of 
      cellular plasticity. This is the first study to show increased numbers of 
      proliferating cells and immature neurons in the hippocampus following touchscreen 
      testing, and that touchscreen training can improve cognitive performance in 
      maze-based spatial navigation tasks. This potential for touchscreen testing to 
      induce cognitive enhancement, or other phenotypic shifts, in preclinical models 
      should be considered in study design. Furthermore, touchscreen-mediated cognitive 
      enhancement could have therapeutic implications for cognitive disorders.

TI  - Detrimental effects of adolescent escalating low-dose Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol 
      leads to a specific bio-behavioural profile in adult male rats.
PG  - 1722-1736
LID - 10.1111/bph.15394 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Adolescent cannabis use is associated with adult 
      psychopathology. When Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), mainly in high doses, is 
      administered to adolescence rats there are also long lasting effects in adults. 
      This study aims to determine the specific adult bio-behavioural profile after 
      adolescent low-dose THC, which better mirrors adolescent recreational cannabis 
      use. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Adolescent male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 
      escalating low-dose of THC. In adulthood, they were evaluated for their 
      spontaneous locomotion, sensorimotor gating, higher order and spatial cognitive 
      functions. Dopaminergic activity and cannabinoid receptor expression were 
      measured in distinct brain regions. Hippocampal neurogenic activity of neural 
      stem cells was determined and protein levels of neuroplasticity-related 
      biomarkers were quantified. Adolescent low-dose THC exposure increased 
      spontaneous open-field activity, without affecting prepulse inhibition and 
      attentional set-shifting performance. Region-specific dopaminergic alterations 
      and CB(1) receptor up-regulation in the prefrontal cortex were observed. Impaired 
      spatial memory, as assessed with the object location task and Morris water maze 
      test, was associated with significantly decreased proliferative activity 
      (SOX2-positive cells), neurogenic potential (decreased doublecortin-positive 
      cells) in the adult hippocampus and defective neuroplasticity, including reduced 
      BDNF expression in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. KEY RESULTS: Our 
      findings reveal the adverse impact of adolescent low-dose THC on the psychomotor 
      profile, dopaminergic neurotransmission, compensatory cannabinoid receptor 
      response, cognition-related neurobiological and behavioural functions. CONCLUSION 
      AND IMPLICATIONS: Our adolescent low-dose THC animal model does not induce 
      tangible psychotic-like effects, such as those reported in high-dose THC studies, 
      but it impairs cognitive functions and points to hippocampal vulnerability and 
      disrupted neurogenesis.

AB  - Cellular polarity is crucial for brain development and morphogenesis. Lethal 
      giant larvae 1 (Lgl1) plays a crucial role in the establishment of cell polarity 
      from Drosophila to mammalian cells. Previous studies have found the importance of 
      Lgl1 in the development of cerebellar, olfactory bulb, and cerebral cortex. 
      However, the role of Lgl1 in hippocampal development during the embryonic stage 
      and function in adult mice is still unknown. In our study, we created 
      Lgl1-deficient hippocampus mice by using Emx1-Cre mice. Histological analysis 
      showed that the Emx1-Lgl1(-/-) mice exhibited reduced size of the hippocampus 
      with severe malformations of hippocampal cytoarchitecture. These defects mainly 
      originated from the disrupted hippocampal neuroepithelium, including increased 
      cell proliferation, abnormal interkinetic nuclear migration, reduced 
      differentiation, increased apoptosis, gradual disruption of adherens junctions, 
      and abnormal neuronal migration. The radial glial scaffold was disorganized in 
      the Lgl1-deficient hippocampus. Thus, Lgl1 plays a distinct role in hippocampal 
      neurogenesis. In addition, the Emx1-Lgl1(-/-) mice displayed impaired behavioral 
      performance in the Morris water maze and fear conditioning test.

AB  - Neurobehavioral studies have produced contradictory findings concerning the 
      function of neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus. Previous studies have proved 
      inconsistent across several behavioral endpoints thought to be dependent on 
      dentate neurogenesis, including memory acquisition, short-term and long-term 
      retention of memory, pattern separation, and reversal learning. We hypothesized 
      that the main function of dentate neurogenesis is long-term memory formation 
      because we assumed that a newly formed and integrated neuron would have a 
      long-term impact on the local neural network. We used a cyclin D2-knock-out 
      (cyclin D2(-/-)) mouse model of endogenously deficient dentate neurogenesis to 
      test this hypothesis. We found that cyclin D2(-/-) mice had robust and sustained 
      loss of long-term memory in two separate behavioral tasks, Morris water maze 
      (MWM) and touchscreen intermediate pattern separation. Moreover, after adjusting 
      for differences in brain volumes determined by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, 
      reduced dentate neurogenesis moderately correlated with deficits in memory 
      retention after 24 hours. Importantly, cyclin D2(-/-) mice did not show deficits 
      in learning acquisition in a touchscreen paradigm of intermediate pattern 
      separation or MWM platform location, indicating intact short-term memory. Further 
      evaluation of cyclin D2(-/-) mice is necessary to confirm that deficits are 
      specifically linked to dentate gyrus neurogenesis since cyclin D2(-/-) mice also 
      have a reduced size of the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, cerebellum and cortex 
      besides reduced dentate gyrus neurogenesis.

AB  - Prenatal drug exposure altered cognitive function in individuals, and may also 
      impact their offspring's susceptibility to cognitive impairment. The high 
      incidence of methamphetamine (METH) abuse among adolescents and women of 
      childbearing age elevates the importance to determine the influence of maternal 
      METH exposure on cognitive functions in the descendants. We hypothesized that 
      maternal METH exposure affects cognitive behavior in offspring mice by disrupting 
      gene expression associated with neural development. Here, female C57BL/6 mice 
      were exposed to intermittent escalating doses of METH or saline from adolescence 
      to adulthood, and then continued through pregnancy. Interestingly, male but not 
      female offspring exhibited impaired short-term recognition memory and long-term 
      spatial memory retention in novel object recognition and Morris water maze test 
      respectively. Additionally, maternal METH exposure altered neurodevelopmental 
      genes in both male and female offspring, and 12 differentially expressed genes 
      between male and female were observed in the HPC and NAc regions. These 
      differentially expressed genes are involved in neurogenesis, axon guidance, 
      neuron migration and synapse of neural development circuits. Our observations 
      suggest that maternal METH exposure induced differential expression patterns of 
      neurodevelopment-related genes in the HPC and NAc of male and female mice, which 
      may underlie the different cognitive behavior phenotypes in both genders.

AB  - Recently, there have been reports that chronic insomnia acts as an insult in the 
      brain, causing memory loss through the production of ROS, inflammation, and, 
      Alzheimer's disease if persistent. Insomnia remains the leading cause of sleep 
      disturbance and as such has serious implications for public health. Patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease are also known to suffer from severe sleep disturbance. 
      Meanwhile, vitexin is a key ingredient in Passiflora incarnata L (passion flower, 
      PF) extract, which is known to help with sleep. This medicinal plant has been 
      used as a folk remedy for sedation, anxiety and sleep since centuries ago, but 
      the standardization work has not been done and the extent of the effect has not 
      been clearly demonstrated. For this reason, we tried to test the possibility that 
      repeated administration of PF could improve the memory by promoting hippocampal 
      neurogenesis at the DBA/2 mice known have inherited sleep disorders, as well as 
      preventive effects of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we found that vitexin, which is 
      the main bioactive component of ethanol extracts from leaves and fruits (ratio; 
      8:2) of PF, confirmed the improvement of neurogenesis (DCX) of DBA/2 mice 
      repeated PF oral administration by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot 
      analysis. PF-treated group showed increased the neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the 
      hippocampus compared with that of vehicle-treated group, but the inflammation 
      markers Iba-1 (microglial marker) and COX-2 were inconsistent between the groups. 
      However, we found COX-2 signal is essential for hippocampal neurogenesis 
      according to the additional IHC experiments using COX-2 inhibitor and pIkappaB 
      have shown. In addition, although prescription sleeping pills have been reported 
      to show significant changes in appetite and metabolic rate from time to time, no 
      changes in the feeding behavior, body weight, metabolic rate and body composition 
      of the animals were observed by administration of PF. Interestingly, we found 
      that short-term oral administration of PF displayed improved memory according to 
      the water maze test. Quantitative analysis of Tau protein, which is a marker of 
      Alzheimer's disease, was performed in the SD rats and DBA/2 mice by repeated PF 
      oral administration and pTau/Tau values were significantly decreased in 
      PF-treated group than vehicle-treated group. In conclusion, our results suggest 
      that PF lead high hippocampal neurogenesis in the animals even in inherited 
      sleep-disturbed animals. The increased hippocampal neurogenesis functionally 
      enhanced memory and learning functions by repeated PF oral administration. These 
      results identify PF as a potential therapy for enhancing memory functions and 
      prevention of Alzheimer's disease through actions on the hippocampus.

AB  - Perivascular stromal cells, including mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), 
      secrete paracrine factor in response to exercise training that can facilitate 
      improvements in muscle remodeling. This study was designed to test the capacity 
      for muscle-resident MSCs (mMSCs) isolated from young mice to release regenerative 
      proteins in response to mechanical strain in vitro, and subsequently determine 
      the extent to which strain-stimulated mMSCs can enhance skeletal muscle and 
      cognitive performance in a mouse model of uncomplicated aging. Protein arrays 
      confirmed a robust increase in protein release at 24h following an acute bout of 
      mechanical strain in vitro (10%, 1Hz, 5h) compared to non-strain controls. Aged 
      (24month old), C57BL/6 mice were provided bilateral intramuscular injection of 
      saline, non-strain control mMSCs, or mMSCs subjected to a single bout of 
      mechanical strain in vitro (4×10(4)). No significant changes were observed in 
      muscle weight, myofiber size, maximal force, or satellite cell quantity at 1 or 
      4wks between groups. Peripheral perfusion was significantly increased in muscle 
      at 4wks post-mMSC injection (p<0.05), yet no difference was noted between control 
      and preconditioned mMSCs. Intramuscular injection of preconditioned mMSCs 
      increased the number of new neurons and astrocytes in the dentate gyrus of the 
      hippocampus compared to both control groups (p<0.05), with a trend toward an 
      increase in water maze performance noted (p=0.07). Results from this study 
      demonstrate that acute injection of exogenously stimulated muscle-resident 
      stromal cells do not robustly impact aged muscle structure and function, yet 
      increase the survival of new neurons in the hippocampus.

AB  - Acrylamide (ACR), a potential neurotoxin, is present in diet and drinking water. 
      Dietary exposure contributes to cognitive impairment, but relevant mechanism 
      information is limited. Neuroinflammation plays important roles in 
      neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to explore whether chronic 
      acrylamide exposure induced neuronal lesions, microglial activation, NLRP3 
      inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. For this 
      purpose, 36 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups 
      (n = 12/group) and maintained on treated drinking water providing dosages of 0, 
      0.5, or 5 mg/kg/day ACR for 12 months. Chronic exposure to ACR caused gait 
      abnormality and cognitive dysfunction, which was associated with neuronal 
      lesions, decrease in synapse associated proteins including synapsin I (SYN1), 
      synaptophysin (SYP) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), neurogenesis 
      suppression as shown by reduced brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 
      doublecortin (DCX) in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. ACR stimulated glial 
      proliferation and microglial activation by increasing GFAP(+), Iba-1(+), 
      Iba-1(+)CD68(+) positive cells. ACR markedly upregulated the protein levels of 
      NLRP3 inflammasome constituents NLRP3, caspase-1 and increased pro-IL-1β and 
      IL-1β. ACR elevated the protein P62 to suppress NLPR3 inflammasome cleavage. 
      Inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6 and Cox-2 were also significantly 
      increased after NF-κB pathway activation, which aggravated neuronal lesions and 
      caused memory deficits. This work helped to propose the possible mechanism of 
      chronic exposure of ACR-induced neurotoxicity.

TI  - Enriched Environment and Social Isolation Affect Cognition Ability via Altering 
      Excitatory and Inhibitory Synaptic Density in Mice Hippocampus.
PG  - 2417-2432

AB  - The purpose of the study was to examine whether the underlying mechanism of the 
      alteration of cognitive ability and synaptic plasticity induced by the housing 
      environment is associated with the balance of excitatory/inhibitory synaptic 
      density. Enriched environment (EE) and social isolation (SI) are two different 
      housing environment, and one is to give multiple sensory environments, the other 
      is to give monotonous and lonely environment. Male 4-week-old C57 mice were 
      divided into three groups: CON, EE and SI. They were housed in the different cage 
      until 3 months of age. Morris water maze and novel object recognition were 
      performed. Long term potentiation (LTP), depotentiation (DEP) and local field 
      potentials were recorded in the hippocampal perforant pathway and dentate gyrus 
      (DG) region. The data showed that EE enhanced the ability of spatial learning, 
      reversal learning and memory as well as LTP/DEP in the hippocampal DG region. 
      Meanwhile, SI reduced those abilities and the level of LTP/DEP. Moreover, there 
      were higher couplings of both phase-amplitude and phase-phase in the EE group, 
      and lower couplings of them in the SI group compared to that in the CON group. 
      Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis showed that EE significantly 
      enhanced the level of PSD-95, NR2B and DCX; however, SI reduced them but 
      increased GABA(A)R(α1) and decreased DCX levels. The data suggests that the 
      cognitive functions, synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis and neuronal oscillatory 
      patterns were significantly impacted by housing environment via possibly changing 
      the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic density.

      hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function.

AB  - Impairment of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus causes cognitive deficits; 
      however, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. 
      microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate neural stem cell (NSC) function. With the use of a 
      transgenic mouse line with conditional ablation of the miR-17-92 cluster in 
      nestin lineage NSCs, we tested the hypothesis that the miR-17-92 cluster 
      regulates adult neurogenesis and cognitive function in vivo. Compared with 
      wild-type mice, ablation of the miR-17-92 cluster significantly reduced the 
      number of proliferating NSCs and neuroblasts and neuronal differentiation in the 
      dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and significantly impaired 
      hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, as assayed by social recognition 
      memory, novel object recognition, and Morris water-maze tests. Statistical 
      analysis showed a highly significant correlation between newly generated 
      neuroblasts in the DG and cognition deficits in miR-17-92 knockout (KO) mice. 
      Western blot analysis showed that conditional KO of the miR-17-92 cluster 
      significantly increased and reduced a cytoskeleton-associated protein, Enigma 
      homolog 1 (ENH1), and its downstream transcription factor, inhibitor of 
      differentiation 1 (ID1), respectively, as well as increased phosphatase and 
      tensin homolog gene. These proteins are related to neuronal differentiation. Our 
      study demonstrates that the miR-17-92 cluster in NSCs is critical for cognitive 
      and behavioral function and regulates neurogenesis and that the miR-17-92 cluster 
      may target ENH1/ID1 signaling.-Pan, W. L., Chopp, M., Fan, B., Zhang, R., Wang,

AB  - Ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22), a potential marker of cancer stem cells, 
      significantly influences stem cell fate choices. However, its functions in neural 
      stem cells (NSCs) and adult neurogenesis, especially following traumatic brain 
      injury (TBI), remain only partially understood. Here, we found that aberrant 
      USP22 expression could affect NSC proliferation and stemness maintenance, as 
      assessed by the generation of neurospheres, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and 
      immunofluorescence staining in vitro. Moreover, USP22 depletion promotes the 
      differentiation of NSCs, both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, USP22 
      overexpression inhibits NSC differentiation into neurons. Interestingly, our data 
      showed that USP22 promotes the proliferation but inhibits the differentiation of 
      NSCs in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus soon after TBI. The Morris 
      water maze (MWM) test was adopted to evaluate neurological function, which 
      confirmed that USP22 could improve the learning and memory capacity that was 
      already compromised following TBI. Overall, this study uncovers a potentially 
      novel regulatory role of USP22 in the proliferation and differentiation ability 
      of NSCs, contributing to the hippocampus-dependent cognitive function of TBI mice 
      and may be a novel target for future therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Enriched environment (EE) with a complex combination of sensorimotor, cognitive 
      and social stimulations has been shown to enhance brain plasticity and improve 
      recovery of functions in animal models of stroke. The present study extended 
      these findings by assessing whether the three-phase EE intervention paradigm 
      would improve neurovascular remodeling following ischemic stroke. Male 
      Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion 
      (MCAO). A three-phase EE intervention paradigm was designed in terms of the 
      different periods of cerebral ischemia by periodically rearranging the EE cage. 
      Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed to evaluate the learning and memory 
      function. Multimodal MRI was applied to examine alterations to brain structures, 
      intracranial vessels, and cerebral perfusion on the 31(st) day after MCAO. The 
      changes of capillaries ultrastructure were examined by transmission electron 
      microscope. Double-immunofluorescent staining was used to evaluate neurogenesis 
      and angiogenesis. The expression of angiogenesis-related factors and 
      neurovascular remodeling related signaling pathways including 
      Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/glycogen synthase 
      kinase-3 (GSK-3)/β-catenin and the axon guidance molecules were detected by 
      Western blot analysis. MRI measurements revealed that EE treatment significantly 
      increased survival volume of cortex and striatum, improved cerebral blood flow 
      (CBF), amplified anterior azygos cerebral artery (azACA), ipsilateral internal 
      carotid artery (ICA) and anterior communicating artery (AComA) vessel signal 
      compared with standard housed rats (IS). Consistent with these findings, EE 
      reduced ischemic BBB damage of capillary, enhanced endogenous angiogenesis and 
      modified the expression of VEGF, Ang-1 or Ang-2 in ischemic rats. Additionally, 
      this proangiogenic effect was consistent with the increased progenitor cell 
      proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the peri-infarct cortex and 
      striatum after EE intervention. Specifically, EE intervention paradigm markedly 
      increased expression of phosphorylated PI3K, AKT and GSK-3, but reduced 
      phosphorylated β-catenin. Moreover, the axon guidance proteins expression level 
      was significant higher in EE group. In parallel to these findings, EE 
      significantly enhanced recovery of lost spatial learning memory function in MCAO 
      rats without affecting infarct size. Together, MRI findings along with 
      histological results strongly supported that the three-phase EE paradigm 
      benefited neurovascular reorganization and thereby improved poststroke cognitive 
      function. Moreover, our findings suggest that this type of EE paradigm induced 
      neurogenesis and angiogenesis, at least in part, via regulating 
      PI3K/AKT/GSK-3/β-catenin signaling pathway and activation of the intrinsic axonal 
      guidance molecules in animal models of ischemic stroke.

TI  - Targeted Dorsal Dentate Gyrus or Whole Brain Irradiation in Juvenile Mice 
      Differently Affects Spatial Memory and Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis.
LID - 10.3390/biology10030192 [doi]
LID - 192
AB  - The cognitive consequences of postnatal brain exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) 
      at low to moderate doses in the adult are not fully established. Because of the 
      advent of pediatric computed tomography scans used for head exploration, 
      improving our knowledge of these effects represents a major scientific challenge. 
      To evaluate how IR may affect the developing brain, models of either whole brain 
      (WB) or targeted dorsal dentate gyrus (DDG) irradiation in C57Bl/6J ten-day-old 
      male mice were previously developed. Here, using these models, we assessed and 
      compared the effect of IR (doses range: 0.25-2 Gy) on long-term spatial memory in 
      adulthood using a spatial water maze task. We then evaluated the effects of IR 
      exposure on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a form of plasticity involved in 
      spatial memory. Three months after WB exposure, none of the doses resulted in 
      spatial memory impairment. In contrast, a deficit in memory retrieval was 
      identified after DDG exposure for the dose of 1 Gy only, highlighting a 
      non-monotonic dose-effect relationship in this model. At this dose, a brain 
      irradiated volume effect was also observed when studying adult hippocampal 
      neurogenesis in the two models. In particular, only DDG exposure caused 
      alteration in cell differentiation. The most deleterious effect observed in adult 
      hippocampal neurogenesis after targeted DDG exposure at 1 Gy may contribute to 
      the memory retrieval deficit in this model. Altogether these results highlight 
      the complexity of IR mechanisms in the brain that can lead or not to cognitive 
      disorders and provide new knowledge of interest for the radiation protection of 
      children.

AB  - Maternal obesity induces hippocampal functional changes and leads to deficits in 
      cognitive functions, such as learning and memory in offspring. We investigated 
      the protective effects of physical exercise against cognitive function deficit in 
      offspring born to obese mothers. Neurotrophic factors, neurogenesis, and 
      apoptosis were analyzed in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus of offspring. 
      Four-week-old female rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks: 12 weeks 
      prior to mating, and 8 weeks during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Male offspring 
      rats were randomly divided into four groups: Control group (CON), exercise and 
      control group (ECON), male offspring born to obese mother group (MOM), and 
      exercise and MOM group (EMOM). In the exercise groups, treadmill exercise was 
      performed 6 times per week for 4 weeks. Male offspring rats were subjected to the 
      Morris water maze tests and step-down avoidance to assess spatial learning and 
      memory, and short-term memory. The result showed that deficits in spatial 
      learning and memory, and short-term memory in male offspring born to obese 
      mothers was associated with decreases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
      levels and neurogenesis, and an increase in apoptosis in the hippocampal dentate 
      gyrus. Physical exercise improved spatial learning and memory, and short-term 
      memory by enhancing BDNF levels and neurogenesis, and by inhibiting apoptosis in 
      the hippocampal dentate gyrus of male offspring born to obese mothers. Our 
      results suggest that physical exercise may be a preventive measure against or a 
      treatment for cognitive function impairment.

TI  - Effect of Lacosamide and Ethosuximide Chronic Treatment on Neural Precursor Cells 
      and Cognitive Functions after Pilocarpine Induced Status Epilepticus in Mice.

AB  - Seizures in about 40% of patients with epilepsy fail to respond to anti-seizure 
      medication (ASM) and may lead to uncontrolled and prolonged seizures often 
      inducing status epilepticus (SE). The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact 
      of a long-term treatment with two different generation ASMs: ethosuximide (ETS, a 
      classic ASM) and lacosamide (LCM, a 3rd generation ASM) on neural stem cells' 
      (NSCs') proliferation and learning and memory functions after pilocarpine 
      (PILO)-induced SE in mice. The following drugs were used: LCM (10 mg/kg), ETS (20 
      mg/kg), and PILO (300 mg/kg). Cell counting was done using confocal microscope 
      and ImageJ software. Cognitive functions were evaluated with the Morris water 
      maze (MWM) test. The level of several selected neurometabolites was measured with 
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Obtained results indicated no significant 
      impact of ETS treatment on the neurogenesis process in PILO mice. Interestingly, 
      LCM significantly decreased the total amount of newborn neurons. The MWM test 
      indicated no significant changes in the time and distance traveled by the ETS and 
      LCM groups compared to PILO control mice, although all measured parameters were 
      more favorable for the PILO mice treated with ASM. Conclusions: The presented 
      results show that long term treatment with LCM and ETS seems to be safe for the 
      cognitive functions and the proper course of neurogenesis in the mouse 
      PILO-induced SE model, although one should remember that LCM administered 
      chronically may act to reduce new neurons' formation.

AB  - Mounting evidence has demonstrated that general anesthetics could induce acute 
      neuroapoptosis in developing animals followed by long-term cognitive dysfunction, 
      with the mechanisms remaining largely unknown. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the effect of the intravenous anesthetic propofol on the profiles of 
      microRNAs (miRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and their interactive signaling 
      networks in the developing mouse hippocampus. Postnatal day 7 (P7) mice were 
      exposed to propofol for 3 hours. Hippocampi were harvested from both P7 (3 hours 
      after exposure) and P60 mice for the analysis of the expression of 726 miRNAs and 
      24,881 mRNAs, and apoptosis. Long-term memory ability of P60 mice was analyzed 
      using the Morris Water Maze. Propofol induced acute apoptosis in the hippocampus, 
      and impaired memory function of mice. There were 100 altered mRNAs and 18 
      dysregulated miRNAs in the propofol-treated hippocampi compared with the 
      intralipid-treated control tissues on P7. Bioinformatics analysis of these 
      abnormally expressed genes on P7 indicated that 34 dysregulated miRNA-mRNA target 
      pairs were related to pathological neurological and developmental disorder 
      processes such as cell viability, cell morphology and migration, neural stem cell 
      proliferation and neurogenesis, oligodendrocyte myelination, reactive oxygen 
      species, and calcium signaling. Neonatal propofol exposure also resulted in the 
      abnormal expression of 49 mRNAs and 4 miRNAs in P60 mouse hippocampi. 
      Specifically, bioinformatics analysis indicates that among these dysregulated 
      mRNAs and miRNAs, there were 2 dysregulated miRNA-mRNA targets pairs 
      (Fam46a/miR-363-3p and Rgs3/miR-363-3p) that might be related to the effect of 
      propofol on long-term cognitive function. Collectively, our novel investigation 
      indicates that acute and long-term dysregulated miRNA-mRNA signaling networks 
      potentially participate in propofol-induced developmental neurotoxicity.

AB  - Cellular plasticity at the structural level and sleep at the behavioural level 
      are both essential for memory formation. The link between the two is not well 
      understood. A functional connection between adult neurogenesis and 
      hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation during NREM sleep has been 
      hypothesized but not experimentally shown. Here, we present evidence that during 
      a three-day learning session in the Morris water maze task a genetic knockout 
      model of adult neurogenesis (Cyclin D2(-/-)) showed changes in sleep macro- and 
      microstructure. Sleep EEG analyses revealed a lower total sleep time and NREM 
      fraction in Cyclin D2(-/-) mice as well as an impairment of sleep specific 
      neuronal oscillations that are associated with memory consolidation. Better 
      performance in the memory task was associated with specific sleep parameters in 
      wild-type, but not in Cyclin D2(-/-) mice. In wild-type animals the number of 
      proliferating cells correlated with the amount of NREM sleep. The lack of adult 
      neurogenesis led to changes in sleep architecture and oscillations that represent 
      the dialog between hippocampus and neocortex during sleep. We suggest that adult 
      neurogenesis-as a key event of hippocampal plasticity-might play an important 
      role for sleep-dependent memory consolidation and modulates learning-induced 
      changes of sleep macro- and microstructure.

PG  - 349-357
LID - 10.1080/01616412.2020.1866351 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: To investigate the effect on vascular dementia of involuntary 
      exercise induced by functional electrical stimulation and of forced and voluntary 
      exercise, focusing on the recovery of cognitive function and using a rat model of 
      dementia.Methods: A demential model was created in Wistar rats who were then 
      given forced exercise, allowed voluntary exercise (wheel running) or had exercise 
      induced through functional electrical stimulation. Their responses were 
      quantified using a Morris water maze and by measuring long-term potentiation in 
      the hippocampus. Immunohistochemical staining was used to evaluate neurogenesis 
      in the hippocampus and Nissl staining was applied to visualize viable neuron loss 
      in the DG sector. In addition, the levels of NMDAR1, AMPAR1, pAMPAR1, pCaMKII, 
      CaMKII, Bcl-2 and Bax in the hippocampus were assessed by western 
      blotting.Results: All of the exercise groups showed a recovery of cognitive 
      performance and improved long-term potentiation. The three modes of exercise all 
      increased the number of DCX immunopositive cells and reduced losses of 
      intact-appearing neurons in the hippocampal DG zones roughly equally. All proved 
      about equally effective in increasing the levels of NMDAR1, pAMPAR1 and pCaMKII 
      and increasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio to protect neurons from apoptosis.Conclusion: 
      Exercise induced by electrical stimulation has beneficial effects comparable to 
      those of other types of exercise for alleviating the cognitive deficits of 
      vascular dementia.

TI  - Cognitive Training as a Potential Activator of Hippocampal Neurogenesis in the 
      Rat Model of Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - There is a growing body of evidence that interventions like cognitive training or 
      exercises prior to the manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms may 
      decelerate cognitive decline. Nonetheless, evidence of prevention or a delay of 
      dementia is still insufficient. Using OXYS rats as a suitable model of sporadic 
      AD and Wistar rats as a control, we examined effects of cognitive training in the 
      Morris water maze on neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus in presymptomatic (young 
      rats) and symptomatic (adult rats) periods of development of AD signs. Four weeks 
      after the cognitive training, we immunohistochemically estimated densities of 
      quiescent and amplifying neuronal progenitors, neuronal-lineage cells 
      (neuroblasts and immature and mature neurons), and astrocytes in young and adult 
      rats, and the amyloid precursor protein and amyloid-β in adult rats. Reference 
      memory was defective in OXYS rats. The cognitive training did not affect 
      neuronal-lineage cells' density in either rat strain either at the young or adult 
      age, but activated neuronal progenitors in young rats and increased astrocyte 
      density and downregulated amyloid-β in adult OXYS rats. Thus, to activate adult 
      neurogenesis, cognitive training should be started before first neurodegenerative 
      changes, whereas cognitive training accompanying amyloid-β accumulation affects 
      only astrocytic support.

TI  - Antidepressant Effects of Rhodomyrtone in Mice with Chronic Unpredictable Mild 
      Stress-Induced Depression.
PG  - 157-164
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyy091 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhodomyrtone is one of the main active compounds derived from 
      Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, which belongs to the Myrtaceae family. In the current 
      study, we investigated the properties of rhodomyrtone as a potential drug 
      candidate for the treatment of stress-caused depression. METHODS: We assessed the 
      function of rhodomyrtone in chronic unpredictable mild stress, a well-validated 
      depression model in mice. Depression-like behavior tests, including a sucrose 
      performance test, social interaction test, and forced swimming test, were used to 
      validate the antidepressant effects of rhodomyrtone. The Morris water maze was 
      used to evaluate the mice's learning and memory ability. Spine density, glycogen 
      synthase kinase-3β, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, postsynaptic density 
      protein 95, and apoptosis-associated protein were detected to reveal the 
      underlying mechanism. RESULTS: Rhodomyrtone was found to prevent source 
      consumption decrease, decreased social behaviors, and increase immobility in the 
      forced swimming test, suggesting a protective effect of rhodomyrtone against 
      depression-like behaviors. Additionally, rhodomyrtone prevented the impairment of 
      spatial memory in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress. Rhodomyrtone 
      administration also reversed dendritic spine density defects in chronic 
      unpredictable mild stress. Furthermore, rhodomyrtone inhibited the increase of 
      glycogen synthase kinase-3β activity and reversed the decrease of brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor and postsynaptic density protein 95 in chronic unpredictable 
      mild stress mice. Elevated expression of apoptosis-associated protein Bax and 
      cleaved-caspase 3 was also reversed by rhodomyrtone treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results suggested that the antidepressant effect of rhodomyrtone involves the 
      regulation of neurogenesis, neuronal survival, and synaptic plasticity in the 
      hippocampus.

TI  - Activation of liver X receptor promotes hippocampal neurogenesis and improves 
      long-term cognitive function recovery in acute cerebral ischemia-reperfusion 
      mice.
PG  - 205-217
LID - 10.1111/jnc.14890 [doi]
AB  - Cerebral ischemia (CI) leads to cognitive dysfunction due to the loss of 
      hippocampal neurons. Liver X receptors (LXRs), including the LXRα and LXRβ 
      isoforms, are critical for neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, neurodegeneration, 
      and cholesterol metabolism. However, the potential role of LXRs in the 
      pathogenesis of CI-induced cognitive impairment is unclear. Therefore, we 
      investigated the effects of LXR activation on hippocampal neurogenesis and 
      cognitive function in mice with CI. C57 mice were randomized into four groups 
      that included a sham group and three treatment groups with CI [Vehicle, TO901317 
      (TO90, an agonist of LXRs) and GSK2033 (an antagonist of LXRs)]. Mice were 
      subjected to bilateral common carotid artery occlusion for 20 min to induce 
      transient CI. The Morris water maze test was executed to detect spatial learning 
      and memory. Proliferation, differentiation, and immature neurons in the 
      subgranular zone (SGZ) were examined using Immunofluorescence. Western blot assay 
      was used to detect the expression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling 
      pathway-associated protein. TO90 significantly improved spatial learning and 
      memory deficits induced by CI on 28 days. It enhanced the proliferation of neural 
      stem cells, the number of immature neurons and the differentiation from nascent 
      cells to neurons. The expression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling 
      pathway-associated protein level was totally increased. The forenamed effects of 
      TO90 were decreased in GSK2033 group. Thus, our findings suggest that LXRs 
      activation can improve long-term cognitive dysfunction caused by CI by increasing 
      neurogenesis, and LXRs may serve as a potential therapeutic target for cerebral 
      ischemia. Cover Image for this issue: doi: 10.1111/jnc.14753.

AB  - According to experimental and clinical findings, fetal brain development may be 
      interrupted by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Adult hippocampal 
      neurogenesis is thought to play a role in cognition function (i.e. learning and 
      memory). Recent evidence suggests that ethanol administration causes major 
      apoptotic neurodegeneration in many regions of the rats' developing brain during 
      the synaptogenesis period. Based on the recent studies, H(2)S improve learning 
      and memory via increased neurogenesis and antiapoptotic mechanisms in different 
      animal models. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the protective effects of 
      hydrogen sulfide on alcohol-induced memory impairment, hippocampus neurogenesis 
      and neuronal apoptosis in rat pups with postnatal ethanol exposure. 
      Administration of ethanol to male rat pups was performed through intragastric 
      intubation on postnatal days 2-10. The pups were administered 1 mg/kg of NaHS 
      (H(2)S donor) on postnatal days 2-10. For examining the spatial memory, Morris 
      water maze test was carried out 36 days after birth. Following the behavioral 
      test, immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate the expression 
      levels of BrdU, BDNF and Apoptotic cell death was detected by TUNEL staining. 
      Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) treatment could significantly improve spatial memory 
      impairment (P < 0.05) and significantly increase the expression of BrdU and BDNF 
      in dentate gyrus area (P < 0.05). It also decreased positive TUNEL cells, 
      compared with the ethanol group (P < 0.01). Based on the findings, H(2)S makes 
      significant neuroprotective effects on Ethanol neurotoxicity due to its 
      neurogenesis and anti-apoptotic activity.

AB  - In this study, the neuro-modulation effect of topical mesenchymal stem cells 
      (MSCs) was tested in a rodent middle carotid artery occlusion (MCAO) model. 
      Twenty-four hours after MCAO, craniotomy was made and 0.8 × 10(6) GFP-MSCs were 
      topically applied to the exposed parietal cortex. The MSCs were fixed in position 
      by a thin layer of fibrin glue (N = 30). In the control group, saline were 
      topically applied to the ipsilateral parietal cortex (N = 30). Three days after 
      topical application, few GFP-positive cells were found in the ischemic penumbra. 
      They expressed GFAP and NeuN. Topical MSCs triggered microglial activation, 
      astrocytosis and cellular proliferation at day 3. The recovery of neurological 
      functions were significantly enhanced as determined in Rotarod test and Morris 
      Water Maze test with smaller infarct volume. PCR array showed that expressions of 
      ten genes of neurogenesis were altered in the penumbra region (fold 
      change > 1.25, p < 0.05) in MSCs group: Apoe, Ascl1, Efnb1, Mef2c, Nog, A100a6 
      and B2m were up-regulated; Pax2, Pax3 and Th were down-regulated. In conclusion, 
      topical application provided a direct and effective transplant method for the 
      delivery of MSCs to the surface of ipsilateral cerebral cortex and the topical 
      MSCs could improve the neurological function from cerebral ischemia resulting 
      from a major cerebral artery occlusion in a rodent experimental model.

TI  - Neonatal Exposure to Low-Dose (1.2%) Sevoflurane Increases Rats' Hippocampal 
      Neurogenesis and Synaptic Plasticity in Later Life.

AB  - The increasing usage of general anesthetics on young children and infants has 
      drawn extensive attention to the effects of these drugs on cognitive function 
      later in life. Recent animal studies have revealed improvement in 
      hippocampus-dependent performance after lower concentrations of sevoflurane 
      exposure. However, the long-term effects of low-dose sevoflurane on the 
      developing brain remain elusive. On postnatal day (P) 7, rats were treated with 
      1.2% sevoflurane (1.2% sevo group), 2.4% sevoflurane (2.4% sevo group), and air 
      control (C group) for 6 h. On P35-40, rats' hippocampus-dependent learning and 
      memory was tested using the Morris water maze. Cognition-related and 
      synapse-related proteins in the hippocampus were measured using Western blotting 
      on P35. On the same day, neurogenesis and synapse ultrastructure were evaluated 
      using immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). On P35, the 
      rats neonatally exposed to 1.2% sevoflurane showed better behavioral results than 
      control rats, but not in the 2.4% sevo group. Exposure to 1.2% sevoflurane 
      increased the number of 5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the 
      dentate gyrus and improved both synaptic number and ultrastructure in the 
      hippocampus. The expression levels of BDNF, TrkB, postsynaptic density (PSD)-95, 
      and synaptophysin in the hippocampus were also increased in the 1.2% sevo group. 
      In contrast, no significant changes in neurogenesis or synaptic plasticity were 
      observed between the C group and the 2.4% sevo group on P35. These results showed 
      that exposure of the developing brain to a low concentration of sevoflurane for 
      6 h could promote spatial learning and memory function, along with increased 
      hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, in later life.

TI  - Chronic Memantine Treatment Ameliorates Behavioral Deficits, Neuron Loss, and 
      Impaired Neurogenesis in a Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 204-216

AB  - Memantine, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist possessing neuroprotective 
      properties, belongs to the small group of drugs which have been approved for the 
      treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While several preclinical studies 
      employing different transgenic AD mouse models have described beneficial effects 
      with regard to rescued behavioral deficits or reduced amyloid plaque pathology, 
      it is largely unknown whether memantine might have beneficial effects on 
      neurodegeneration. In the current study, we assessed whether memantine treatment 
      has an impact on hippocampal neuron loss and associated behavioral deficits in 
      the Tg4-42 mouse model of AD. We demonstrate that a chronic oral memantine 
      treatment for 4 months diminishes hippocampal CA1 neuron loss and rescues 
      learning and memory performance in different behavioral paradigms, such as Morris 
      water maze or a novel object recognition task. Cognitive benefits of chronic 
      memantine treatment were accompanied by an amelioration of impaired adult 
      hippocampal neurogenesis. Taken together, our results demonstrate that memantine 
      successfully counteracts pathological alterations in a preclinical mouse model of 
      AD.

TI  - Co-Ultra PEALut Enhances Endogenous Repair Response Following Moderate Traumatic 
      Brain Injury.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22168717 [doi]
LID - 8717
AB  - This study aimed to assess the neuro-regenerative properties of 
      co-ultramicronized PEALut (Glialia(®)), composed of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) 
      and the flavonoid luteolin (Lut), in an in vivo model of traumatic brain injury 
      (TBI) and patients affected by moderate TBI. An increase in neurogenesis was seen 
      in the mice at 72 h and 7 d after TBI. The co-ultra PEALut treatment helped the 
      neuronal reconstitution process to restore the basal level of both novel and 
      mature neurons; moreover, it induced a significant upregulation of the 
      neurotrophic factors, which ultimately led to progress in terms of memory recall 
      during behavioral testing. Moreover, our preliminary findings in a clinical trial 
      suggested that Glialia(®) treatment facilitated neural recovery on working 
      memory. Thus, co-ultra PEALut (Glialia(®)) could represent a valuable therapeutic 
      agent for intensifying the endogenous repair response in order to better treat 
      TBI.

TI  - Histidine Alleviates Impairments Induced by Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion in 
      Mice.
PG  - 662
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2018.00662 [doi]
LID - 662
AB  - Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is one of the fundamental pathological causes of 
      brain disease such as vascular dementia. Exploration of effective treatments for 
      this is of great interest. Histidine has been reported to be effective in 
      anti-apoptosis, antioxidant, and against excitotoxicity. In the present study, we 
      aim to investigate whether histidine could have a therapeutic effect on the 
      impairments induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Cerebral hypoperfusion 
      model was established through bilateral common carotid arteries stenosis (BCAS) 
      operation in Tie2-GFP mice. Radial arm maze and Morris water maze revealed that 
      histidine showed potential improvement of the tendency of cognitive impairments 
      induced by hypoperfusion. The possible mechanisms were further investigated. 
      After administration of histidine in hypoperfusion mice, immunofluorescent BrdU 
      staining revealed more new-born nerve cells. In vivo observation through a 
      cranial window under two-photon laser-scanning microscopy demonstrated that the 
      blood flow velocity in capillary was improved, the distance between the 
      astrocytes and the penetrating artery was shortened. Histidine administration 
      also significantly increased the protein expression level of zonula occludens 
      protein 1, an indicator of the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB). These 
      results suggest that histidine could alleviate the impairments induced by chronic 
      cerebral hypoperfusion in mice, and this effect may be related to the 
      neurogenesis, astrocytes, and the integrity of the BBB.

AB  - AIMS: Improving the environment of the injured area and the preconditioning of 
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising approaches to optimize the 
      therapeutic properties of transplanted MSCs. Herein we investigated the 
      synergistic effects of treadmill exercise and dimethyloxalylglycine 
      (DMOG)-preconditioned stem cells in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal model. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MSCs were treated with DMOG for 24 h and transplanted 
      in the AD model intravenously. In addition to cell transplantation, the rats went 
      on treadmill exercise for one month. Memory function, BDNF expression, 
      neurogenesis, apoptosis, and antioxidant capacity were assessed using shuttle box 
      and Morris water maze tasks, ELISA, immunohistochemistry, western blot, and 
      biochemical methods. KEY FINDINGS: Transplantation of DMOG-treated cells caused a 
      memory improvement compared to the AD group via an increase in neurogenesis and 
      expression of nestin, Sox-2, and NeuroD. Moreover, the injection of 
      preconditioned cells was more effective in increasing the total antioxidant 
      capacity and the BDNF level and decreasing the MDA and caspase-3 than the 
      non-treated cells. Treadmill exercise improved spatial memory and learning 
      through an increase in BDNF and neurogenesis. Finally, treadmill exercise and 
      transplantation of the treated cells together had the most neuroprotective 
      effects. SIGNIFICANCE: It seems that the transplantation of DMOG-treated cells 
      besides exercise may have protective effects in the AD model via an increase in 
      BDNF, antioxidants, and neurogenesis and a decrease in apoptosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have demonstrated that transplanted multipotent 
      mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) improve functional recovery in rats after 
      experimental intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In this study the authors tested the 
      hypothesis that administration of multipotent MSC-derived exosomes promotes 
      functional recovery, neurovascular remodeling, and neurogenesis in a rat model of 
      ICH. METHODS: Sixteen adult male Wistar rats were subjected to ICH via blood 
      injection into the striatum, followed 24 hours later by tail vein injection of 
      100 μg protein of MSC-derived exosomes (treatment group, 8 rats) or an equal 
      volume of vehicle (control group, 8 rats); an additional 8 rats that had 
      identical surgery without blood infusion were used as a sham group. The modified 
      Morris water maze (mMWM), modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS), and social 
      odor-based novelty recognition tests were performed to evaluate cognitive and 
      sensorimotor functional recovery after ICH. All 24 animals were killed 28 days 
      after ICH or sham procedure. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses 
      were performed for measurements of lesion volume and neurovascular and white 
      matter remodeling. RESULTS: Compared with the saline-treated controls, 
      exosome-treated ICH rats showed significant improvement in the neurological 
      function of spatial learning and motor recovery measured at 26-28 days by mMWM 
      and starting at day 14 by mNSS (p < 0.05). Senorimotor functional improvement was 
      measured by a social odor-based novelty recognition test (p < 0.05). Exosome 
      treatment significantly increased newly generated endothelial cells in the 
      hemorrhagic boundary zone, neuroblasts and mature neurons in the subventricular 
      zone, and myelin in the striatum without altering the lesion volume. CONCLUSIONS: 
      MSC-derived exosomes effectively improve functional recovery after ICH, possibly 
      by promoting endogenous angiogenesis and neurogenesis in rats after ICH. Thus, 
      cell-free, MSC-derived exosomes may be a novel therapy for ICH.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The incidence rate of senile dementia is rising, and there is no 
      definite cure for it yet. Cell therapy, as a new investigational approach, has 
      shown promising results. Hair bulges with abundant easily accessible neural stem 
      cells permit autologous implantation in irreversible neurodegenerative disorders. 
      METHODS: Fifty rats were randomly divided into 5 groups of control, 
      sham-operation, two-common carotid vessel-occlusion rats that received vehicle 
      (2VO + V), 2VO rats that received 1 × 10(6) epidermal stem cells (2VO + ESC1), 
      and 2VO rats that received 2.5 × 10(6) epidermal stem cells (2VO + ESC2) in 
      300 µl PBS intravenously on days 4, 9, and 14 after surgery. The epidermal neural 
      crest stem cells (EPI-NCSCs) were isolated from hair follicles of rat whiskers. 
      The open-field, passive avoidance, and Morris water maze were used as behavioral 
      tests. The basal-synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation (LTP), and 
      short-term synaptic plasticity were evaluated by field-potential recording of the 
      CA1 hippocampal area. RESULTS: 30 days after the first transplantation in the 
      2VO + ESC1 group, functional recovery was prominent in anxiety and fear memory 
      compared to the 2VO + ESC2 group, while LTP induction was recovered in both 
      groups of grafted animals without improvement in basal synaptic transmission. 
      These positive recoveries may be related to the release of different neurotrophic 
      factors from grafted cells that can stimulate endogenous neurogenesis and 
      synaptic plasticity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that EPI-NCSCs implantation 
      could rescue LTP and cognitive disability in 2VO rats, while transplantation of 1 
      million cells showed better performance relative to 2.5 million cells.

TI  - Environmental Enrichment Protects Offspring of a Rat Model of Preeclampsia from 
      Cognitive Decline.
PG  - 381-394

AB  - Preeclampsia affects 5-7% of all pregnancies and contributes to adverse pregnancy 
      and birth outcomes. In addition to the short-term effects of preeclampsia, 
      preeclampsia can exert long-term adverse effects on offspring. Numerous studies 
      have demonstrated that offspring of preeclamptic women exhibit cognitive deficits 
      from childhood to old age. However, effective ways to improve the cognitive 
      abilities of these offspring remain to be investigated. The aim of this study was 
      to explore whether environmental enrichment in early life could restore the 
      cognitive ability of the offspring of a rat model of preeclampsia and to 
      investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which EE improves cognitive 
      ability. L-NAME was used to establish a rat model of preeclampsia. The spatial 
      learning and memory abilities and recognition memory of 56-day-old offspring were 
      evaluated by the Morris water maze and Novel object recognition (NOR) task. 
      Immunofluorescence was performed to evaluate cell proliferation and apoptosis in 
      the DG region of the hippocampus. qRT-PCR was performed to examine the expression 
      levels of neurogenesis-associated genes, pre- and postsynaptic proteins and 
      inflammatory cytokines. An enzyme-linked immune absorbent assay was performed to 
      evaluate the concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and 
      inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus. The administration of L-NAME led to 
      increased systolic blood pressure and urine protein levels in pregnant rats. 
      Offspring in the L-NAME group exhibited impaired spatial learning ability and 
      memory as well as NOR memory. Hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity 
      were impaired in offspring from the L-NAME group. Furthermore, cell apoptosis in 
      the hippocampus was increased in the L-NAME group. The hippocampus was skewed to 
      a proinflammatory profile, as shown by increased inflammatory cytokine levels. EE 
      improved the cognitive ability of offspring in the L-NAME group and resulted in 
      increased hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic protein expression levels and 
      decreased apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine levels. Environmental enrichment 
      resolves cognitive impairment in the offspring of a rat model of preeclampsia by 
      improving hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity and normalizing the 
      apoptosis level and the inflammatory balance.

AB  - ABSTRACТPurpose: To explore if the total body γ-irradiation at a dose of 0.1 Gy 7 
      days prior to acute mixed γ, n-irradiation of the head at the dose of 1 Gy can 
      reduce the harmful effects of neutron irradiation on the hippocampal functions, 
      neuroinflammation and neurogenesis.Materials and methods: Mice were exposed to 
      γ-radiation alone, mixed γ,n-radiation or combined γ-rays and γ,n-radiation 7 
      days after γ-irradiation. Two months post-irradiation, mice were tested in Open 
      Field and in the Morris water maze. The content of microglia, astrocytes, 
      proliferating cells and cytokines TGF-β, TNF-α, IL-1β, GFAP levels, hippocampal 
      BDNF, NT-3, NT-4, NGF mRNA expression were evaluated.Results: Two months after 
      combined irradiation, we observed impaired hippocampus-dependent cognition, which 
      was not detected in mice exposed to γ,n-irradiation. Combined exposure and 
      γ,n-irradiation led to a significant increase in the level of activated microglia 
      and astrocytes in the brains. The level of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines 
      in the brain and hippocampal neurotrophine's genes changed differenly after the 
      combined exposure and γ,n-irradiation. The quantity of DCX-positive cells was 
      reduced after γ,n-irradiation exposer alone, but increased after combined 
      irradiation.Conclusions: Our results indicate radio-adaptive responses in brains 
      of mice that were exposed to low-dose gamma irradiation 7 days prior to acute 1 
      Gy γ,n-irradiation.

TI  - Helicid Ameliorates Learning and Cognitive Ability and Activities cAMP/PKA/CREB 
      Signaling in Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress Rats.
PG  - 1146-1154
LID - 10.1248/bpb.b19-00012 [doi]
AB  - Helicid (4-formylphenyl-O-β-D-allopyranoside), an active component found in seeds 
      from the Chinese herb Helicia nilagirica, has been reported to exert sedative, 
      analgesic, hypnotic and antidepressant effects. The present study was designed to 
      evaluate the antidepressant, learning and cognitive improvement effects of 
      helicid in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression in rats 
      and to explore cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP response element-binding (CREB) 
      signaling pathway. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to six groups 
      (n = 10): control; CUMS; CUMS + fluoxetine (5 mg/kg) and CUMS + helicid at 8, 16 
      and 32 mg/kg. All rats were subjected to 12 weeks of CUMS protocols and drug 
      administration during the last 6 weeks of CUMS. Our results showed that helicid, 
      at a dose of 32 mg/kg, significantly reversed decreases in body weight and 
      sucrose consumption, increased the distance and number of crossings in the 
      open-field test (OFT), reduced immobility times in the forced swimming test (FST) 
      and improved spatial memory in the Morris water maze (MWM); all of these effects 
      had been induced by CUMS paradigm. Immunohistochemistry showed that 
      administration of helicid could promoted the proliferation of neurons in the 
      hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions. CUMS rats treated with helicid 
      had dramatically decreased protein levels of serotonin transporters (SERTs). In 
      addition, CUMS resulted in a significant reduction in the expression of cAMP, PKA 
      C-α and p-CREB, each of which were partially attenuated by helicid 
      administration. These results indicated that helicid could improve depressive 
      behaviors, learning and cognitive deficits and increase hippocampal neurogenesis, 
      which may be mediated by the regulation of SERTs, activation of the cAMP/PKA/CREB 
      signaling pathway and upregulation of p-CREB levels in hippocampal.

AB  - Impaired behavioral flexibility and repetitive behavior is a common phenotype in 
      autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders, but the underlying synaptic 
      mechanisms are poorly understood. The trans-synaptic glutamate delta 
      (GluD)-Cerebellin 1-Neurexin complex, critical for synapse formation/maintenance, 
      represents a vulnerable axis for neuropsychiatric diseases. We have previously 
      found that GluD1 deletion results in reversal learning deficit and repetitive 
      behavior. In this study, we show that selective ablation of GluD1 from the dorsal 
      striatum impairs behavioral flexibility in a water T-maze task. We further found 
      that striatal GluD1 is preferentially found in dendritic shafts, and more 
      frequently associated with thalamic than cortical glutamatergic terminals 
      suggesting localization to projections from the thalamic parafascicular nucleus 
      (Pf). Conditional deletion of GluD1 from the striatum led to a selective loss of 
      thalamic, but not cortical, terminals, and reduced glutamatergic 
      neurotransmission. Optogenetic studies demonstrated functional changes at 
      thalamostriatal synapses from the Pf, but no effect on the corticostriatal 
      system, upon ablation of GluD1 in the dorsal striatum. These studies suggest a 
      novel molecular mechanism by which genetic variations associated with 
      neuropsychiatric disorders may impair behavioral flexibility, and reveal a unique 
      principle by which GluD1 subunit regulates forebrain circuits.

AB  - We aimed to elucidate the role of cortical and hippocampal dendritic spines on 
      neurological deficits associated with hippocampal microgliosis, hippocampal 
      neurogenesis, and neuroinflammation in mice with cortical compact impact (CCI) 
      injury. In the present study, we found that CCI reduced spatial memory mean 
      latency (10 s. vs 50 s) and motor dysfunction (130 s. vs 150 s.) in mice, as 
      determined by Morris water maze and rotarod test, respectively. Golgi staining of 
      cortical pyramidal neurons revealed that, compared to the controls, the CCI group 
      treated with vehicle solution had significantly lower values of dendritic order 
      (or dendritic branch number) (4.0 vs 6.2), total spine length (400 μm vs 620 μm) 
      and spine density (40 spines/μm vs 60 spines/μm), but had significantly higher 
      values of dendritic beading (40 beadings/mm vs 20 beadings/mm). Additionally, 
      Sholl analysis showed that, compared to controls, the CCI + NS group mice had 
      significantly lower values of dendritic intersections (1.0 vs 2.0). 
      Immunofluorescence assay also revealed that, compared to controls, the CCI + NS 
      group mice had significantly higher values of the newly formed hippocampal cells 
      (1250/mm(2) vs 1000/mm(2)) but significantly lower values of dendritic order (2.0 
      branch # vs 4.2 branch #), total spine length (180 μm vs 320 μm) and intersection 
      (1.0 vs 3.0). The CCI + NS group mice further showed significantly higher numbers 
      of microglia in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and higher concentrations of 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluids. All the CCI-induced 
      spatial memory (40 s) and motor (150 s) dysfunction, deranged dendritic and spine 
      morphology of cortical pyramidal neurons or hippocampal newly formed cells, 
      hippocampal microgliosis, and central neuroinflammation were all significantly 
      reduced by melatonin administration during post-CCI. Simultaneously, melatonin 
      therapy caused an enhancement in the compensatory hippocampal neurogenesis and 
      neurotrophic growth factors (e.g., doublecortin-1) and compensatory central 
      anti-inflammatory cytokines. Our results indicate that melatonin attenuates the 
      spatial memory and motor deficits via the modification of cortical and 
      hippocampal dendritic spine morphology, hippocampal microgliosis and 
      neurogenesis, and neuroinflammation in mice with traumatic brain injury.

TI  - Dysregulated expression of monoacylglycerol lipase is a marker for anti-diabetic 
      drug metformin-targeted therapy to correct impaired neurogenesis and spatial 
      memory in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 6337-6360
LID - 10.7150/thno.44962 [doi]
AB  - Rationale: Monoacylglycerol lipase (Mgll), a hydrolase that breaks down the 
      endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) to produce arachidonic acid (ARA), 
      is a potential target for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD). Increasing evidence shows that impairment of adult neurogenesis by 
      perturbed lipid metabolism predisposes patients to AD. However, it remains 
      unknown what causes aberrant expression of Mgll in AD and how Mgll-regulated 
      lipid metabolism impacts adult neurogenesis, thus predisposing to AD during 
      aging. Here, we identify Mgll as an aging-induced factor that impairs adult 
      neurogenesis and spatial memory in AD, and show that metformin, an FDA-approved 
      anti-diabetic drug, can reduce the expression of Mgll to reverse impaired adult 
      neurogenesis, prevent spatial memory decline and reduce β-amyloid accumulation. 
      Methods: Mgll expression was assessed in both human AD patient post-mortem 
      hippocampal tissues and 3xTg-AD mouse model. In addition, we used both the 
      3xTg-AD animal model and the CbpS436A genetic knock-in mouse model to identify 
      that elevated Mgll expression is caused by the attenuation of the aPKC-CBP 
      pathway, involving atypical protein kinase C (aPKC)-stimulated Ser436 
      phosphorylation of histone acetyltransferase CBP through biochemical methods. 
      Furthermore, we performed in vivo adult neurogenesis assay with BrdU/EdU 
      labelling and Morris water maze task in both animal models following 
      pharmacological treatments to show the key role of Mgll in metformin-corrected 
      neurogenesis and spatial memory deficits of AD through reactivating the aPKC-CBP 
      pathway. Finally, we performed in vitro adult neurosphere assays using both 
      animal models to study the role of the aPKC-CBP mediated Mgll repression in 
      determining adult neural stem/progenitor cell (NPC) fate. Results: Here, we 
      demonstrate that aging-dependent induction of Mgll is observed in the 3xTg-AD 
      model and human AD patient post-mortem hippocampal tissues. Importantly, we 
      discover that elevated Mgll expression is caused by the attenuation of the 
      aPKC-CBP pathway. The accumulation of Mgll in the 3xTg-AD mice reduces the 
      genesis of newborn neurons and perturbs spatial memory. However, we find that 
      metformin-stimulated aPKC-CBP pathway decreases Mgll expression to recover these 
      deficits in 3xTg-AD. In addition, we reveal that elevated Mgll levels in cultured 
      adult NPCs from both 3xTg-AD and CbpS436A animal models are responsible for their 
      NPC neuronal differentiation deficits. Conclusion: Our findings set the stage for 
      development of a clinical protocol where Mgll would serve as a biomarker in early 
      stages of AD to identify potential metformin-responsive AD patients to restore 
      their neurogenesis and spatial memory.

AB  - Dementia poses major health challenges worldwide, yet current treatments are 
      faced with issues of efficacy and toxicity. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a 
      promising non-pharmacological treatment for dementia, but most DBS studies use 
      young healthy animals, which may not be aetiologically relevant. In this study, 
      we used an aged rat model in which cognitive decline occurs through a natural 
      ageing process. We used a Morris water maze (MWM) to determine the effects of 
      prelimbic cortex (PrL) DBS on memory in aged rats. To investigate the underlying 
      mechanisms of the effects of DBS, we carried out microarray, quantitative PCR 
      analysis, and mass spectrometry to detect gene expression and neurotransmitter 
      changes in the hippocampus. We showed PrL DBS improved the performance in MWM, 
      with related distinct patterns of gene expression involving G protein-coupled 
      receptor pathways. We further found neurotransmitter changes in the dorsal 
      hippocampus, which corroborated and extended the microarray findings. Our results 
      suggest that non-neurogenesis pathways play roles in the effects of DBS. Further 
      studies are needed to investigate the effects of DBS on memory beyond 
      neurogenesis and to consider the highlighted pathways suggested by our data.

AB  - The Hamlet test is an innovative device providing a complex environment for 
      testing topographic memory in mice. Animals were trained in groups for weeks in a 
      small village with a central agora, streets expanding from it towards five 
      functionalized houses, where they can drink, eat, hide, run, interact with a 
      stranger mouse. Memory was tested by depriving mice from water or food and 
      analyzing their ability to locate the Drink/Eat house. Exploration and memory 
      were analyzed in different strains, gender, and after different training periods 
      and delays. After 2 weeks training, differences in exploration patterns were 
      observed between strains, but not gender. Neuroanatomical structures activated by 
      training, identified using FosB/ΔFosB immunolabelling, showed an involvement of 
      the hippocampus-subiculum-parahippocampal gyrus axis and dopaminergic structures. 
      Training increased hippocampal neurogenesis (cell proliferation and neuronal 
      maturation) and modified the amnesic efficacy of muscarinic or nicotinic 
      cholinergic antagonists. Moreover, topographical disorientation in Alzheimer's 
      disease was addressed using intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid β(25-35) 
      peptide in trained mice. When retested after 7 days, Aβ(25-35)-treated mice 
      showed memory impairment. The Hamlet test specifically allows analysis of 
      topographical memory in mice, based on complex environment. It offers an 
      innovative tool for various ethological or pharmacological research needs. For 
      instance, it allowed to examine topographical disorientation, a warning sign in 
      Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Isoflurane preconditioning effects on brain damage induced by electromagnetic 
      pulse radiation through epigenetic modification of BDNF gene transcription.
PG  - 3418-3427
LID - 10.21037/apm-20-1655 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) radiation on cognitive 
      impairment have attracted much attention, but the mechanism is still unclear. 
      Regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression has been 
      found to promote memory formation and neuronal survival. Isoflurane 
      preconditioning (IP) was reported to have a neuroprotective effect. In this 
      study, we verified the protective effect of IP against brain injury induced by 
      EMP exposure and examined the relation of this effect with BDNF gene regulation. 
      METHODS: Twenty-four hours before EMP exposure, rats were pretreated with 2% 
      inhaled isoflurane for 30 minutes. At 24 hours after EMP injury, the Morris water 
      maze test was carried out. Meanwhile, the other rats were executed and their 
      brain tissues were used for Nissl staining, qRT-PCR, western blot and chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: The Morris water maze results showed that 2% IP 
      improved the spatial learning and memory ability of the rats. The Nissl staining 
      results showed 2% of IP alleviated neuronal damage. Also, we detected the mRNA 
      and protein expression of BDNF, and 2% IP significantly increased the expression 
      of BDNF. We also found the expression level of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) was 
      increased and that EMP exposure significantly decreased H3 acetylation, while 2% 
      IP reversed these phenomena, individually, BDNF transcription was activated, and 
      neurogenesis after EMP exposure was alleviated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      suggested that 2% of IP alleviates cognitive impairment induced by EMP exposure 
      in rats. Also, the sustained elevated level of BDNF gene transcription may be an 
      essential mechanism for stimulating neurogenesis because of the increased level 
      of HDAC2-dependent H3 acetylation.

AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) regulates angio/neurogenesis and also 
      tightly links to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although exercise 
      has a beneficial effect on neurovascular function and cognitive function, the 
      direct effect of exercise on VEGF-related signaling and cognitive deficit in AD 
      is incompletely understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 
      investigate the protective effect of exercise on angiostatin/VEGF cascade and 
      cognitive function in AD model rats. Wistar male rats were randomly divided into 
      five groups: control (CON), injection of DMSO (Sham-CON), CON-exercise (sham-EX), 
      intrahippocampal injection of Aβ (Aβ), and Aβ-exercise (Aβ-EX). Rats in EX groups 
      underwent treadmill exercise for 4 weeks, then the cognitive function was 
      measured by the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. mRNA levels of hypoxia-induced 
      factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and angiostatin were determined in 
      hippocampus by RT-PCR. We found that spatial learning and memory were impaired in 
      Aβ-injected rats, but exercise training improved it. Moreover, exercise training 
      increased the reduced mRNA expression level of VEGF signaling, including HIF1α, 
      VEGF, and VEGFR2 in the hippocampus from Aβ-injected rats. Also, the mRNA 
      expression level of angiostatin was elevated in the hippocampus from Aβ-injected 
      rats, and exercise training abrogated its expression. Our findings suggest that 
      exercise training improves cognitive function in Aβ-injected rats, possibly 
      through enhancing VEGF signaling and reducing angiostatin.

TI  - Neonatal Exposure to Propofol Interferes with the Proliferation and 
      Differentiation of Hippocampal Neural Stem Cells and the Neurocognitive Function 
      of Rats in Adulthood via the Akt/p27 Signaling Pathway.
PG  - 283-295

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neonatal exposure to propofol has been reported to cause neurotoxicity 
      and neurocognitive decline in adulthood; however, the underlying mechanism has 
      not been established. METHODS: SD rats were exposed to propofol on postnatal day 
      7 (PND-7). Double-immunofluorescence staining was used to assess neurogenesis in 
      the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). The expression of p-Akt and p27 were measured 
      by western blotting. The Morris water maze, novel object recognition test, and 
      object location test were used to evaluate neurocognitive function 2-month-old 
      rats. RESULTS: Phosphorylation of Akt was inhibited, while p27 expression was 
      enhanced after neonatal exposure to propofol. Propofol also inhibited 
      proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and decreased differentiation to 
      neurons and astroglia. Moreover, the neurocognitive function in 2-month-old rats 
      was weakened. Of significance, intra-hippocampal injection of the Akt activator, 
      SC79, attenuated the inhibition of p-AKT and increase of p27 expression. SC79 
      also rescued the propofol-induced inhibition of NSC proliferation and 
      differentiation. The propofol-induced neurocognition deficit was also partially 
      reversed by SC79. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggest that 
      neurogenesis is hindered by neonatal propofol exposure. Specifically, neonatal 
      propofol exposure was shown to suppress the proliferation and differentiation of 
      NSCs by inhibiting Akt/p27 signaling pathway.

AB  - Intrauterine exposure to exercise is beneficial to cognition of the offspring. 
      Although it is advisable to start practicing physical exercise during pregnancy, 
      it is probable that practitioners or sedentary women keep their previous habits 
      during gestation. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of maternal 
      aerobic exercise initiated before and maintained during gestation, or performed 
      in these isolated periods, on cognition and plasticity in the hippocampus of 
      offspring. Groups of male pups were categorized by the exposure of their mothers 
      to: treadmill off (sedentary, SS), pregestational exercise (ES), gestational 
      exercise (SE) or combined protocols (EE). Between postnatal day 20 (P20) and P23 
      the offspring received one daily 5-bromo-2'-deoxiuridine (BrdU) injection and, 
      from P47 to P51, were evaluated by the Morris water maze task. At P53, 
      hippocampal global DNA methylation, survival of progenitor cells (BrdU), 
      Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and reelin levels were measured. The 
      offspring from ES, SE and EE mothers demonstrated improved spatial learning 
      compared to SS, but hippocampal DNA methylation was significantly modified only 
      in the offspring from ES mothers. The offspring from ES and SE mothers presented 
      higher number of BrdU+ and reelin+ hippocampal cells than EE and SS. No 
      differences were observed in the BDNF levels among the groups. The maternal 
      pregestational and gestational isolated exercise protocols showed similar effects 
      for offspring plasticity and spatial cognitive ability, while the combined 
      protocol simply improved their spatial learning. Interestingly, only 
      pregestational exercise was able to induce plasticity in the offspring 
      hippocampus associated with modulation of global DNA methylation.

      cerebral cortex.

AB  - The highly organized laminar structure of the mammalian brain is dependent on 
      successful neuronal migration, and migration deficits can cause lissencephaly and 
      behavioral and cognitive defects. Here, we investigated the contribution of 
      neuronal migration dysregulation to anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity in the fetal 
      brain. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice at embryonic day 14.5 received 2.5% sevoflurane 
      daily for two days. Cortical neuron migration and axon lengths were evaluated 
      using GFP immunostaining. Morris water maze tests were performed to assess the 
      effects of sevoflurane exposure on spatial memory in offspring. We found that 
      sevoflurane exposure decreased axon length and caused cognitive defects in young 
      mice. RNA sequencing revealed that these defects were associated with reduced 
      neuro-oncological ventral antigen 2 (Nova2) expression. In utero electroporation 
      experiments using Nova2 shRNA recapitulated this finding. Nova2 shRNA inhibited 
      neuronal migration and decreased axon lengths. Finally, we found that 
      Netrin-1/Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (Dcc) proteins acted downstream of Nova2 to 
      suppresses neuronal migration. These findings describe a novel mechanism by which 
      prenatal anesthesia exposure affects embryonic neural development and postnatal 
      behavior.

AB  - Ageing is characterised by memory deficits, associated with brain plasticity 
      impairment. Polyphenols from berries, such as flavan-3-ols, anthocyanins, and 
      resveratrol, have been suggested to modulate synaptic plasticity and cognitive 
      processes. In the present study we assessed the preventive effect of a 
      polyphenol-rich extract from grape and blueberry (PEGB), with high concentrations 
      of flavonoids, on age-related cognitive decline in mice. Adult and aged (6 weeks 
      and 16 months) mice were fed a PEGB-enriched diet for 14 weeks. Learning and 
      memory were assessed using the novel object recognition and Morris water maze 
      tasks. Brain polyphenol content was evaluated with ultra-high-performance 
      LC-MS/MS. Hippocampal neurotrophin expression was measured using quantitative 
      real-time PCR. Finally, the effect of PEGB on adult hippocampal neurogenesis was 
      assessed by immunochemistry, counting the number of cells expressing doublecortin 
      and the proportion of cells with dendritic prolongations. The combination of 
      grape and blueberry polyphenols prevented age-induced learning and memory 
      deficits. Moreover, it increased hippocampal nerve growth factor (Ngf) mRNA 
      expression. Aged supplemented mice displayed a greater proportion of newly 
      generated neurons with prolongations than control age-matched mice. Some of the 
      polyphenols included in the extract were detected in the brain in the native form 
      or as metabolites. Aged supplemented mice also displayed a better survival rate. 
      These data suggest that PEGB may prevent age-induced cognitive decline. Possible 
      mechanisms of action include a modulation of brain plasticity. Post-treatment 
      detection of phenolic compounds in the brain suggests that polyphenols may act 
      directly at the central level, while they can make an impact on mouse survival 
      through a potential systemic effect.

TI  - Cholecystokinin octapeptide improves hippocampal glutamatergic synaptogenesis and 
      postoperative cognition by inhibiting induction of A1 reactive astrocytes in aged 
      mice.
PG  - 1374-1384
LID - 10.1111/cns.13718 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Delayed neurocognitive recovery (dNCR) is a common postoperative 
      complication in geriatric surgical patients for which there is no efficacious 
      therapy. Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), an immunomodulatory peptide, 
      regulates memory and learning. Here, we explored the effects and mechanism of 
      action of CCK-8 on dNCR. METHODS: We applied laparotomy to establish a model of 
      dNCR in aged mice. Morris water maze and fear conditioning tests were used to 
      evaluate cognition. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the density of CCK-8, 
      A1 reactive astrocytes, glutamatergic synapses, and activation of microglia in 
      the hippocampus. Quantitative PCR was performed to determine mRNA levels of 
      synapse-associated factors. A1 reactive astrocytes, activated microglia, and 
      glutamatergic synapse-associated protein levels in the hippocampus were assessed 
      by western blotting. RESULTS: Administration of CCK-8 suppressed the activation 
      of microglia, the induction of A1 reactive astrocytes, and the expression of 
      tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement 1q, and interleukin 1 alpha in the 
      hippocampus. Furthermore, it promoted glutamatergic synaptogenesis and 
      neurocognitive recovery in aged dNCR model mice. CONCLUSION: Our findings 
      indicated that CCK-8 alleviated cognitive impairment and promoted glutamatergic 
      synaptogenesis by inhibiting the induction of A1 reactive astrocytes and the 
      activation of microglia. CCK-8 is, therefore, a potential therapeutic target for 
      dNCR.

TI  - Preclinical Assessment of a New Hybrid Compound C11 Efficacy on Neurogenesis and 
      Cognitive Functions after Pilocarpine Induced Status Epilepticus in Mice.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22063240 [doi]
LID - 3240
AB  - Status epilepticus (SE) is a frequent medical emergency that can lead to a 
      variety of neurological disorders, including cognitive impairment and abnormal 
      neurogenesis. The aim of the presented study was the in vitro evaluation of 
      potential neuroprotective properties of a new pyrrolidine-2,5-dione derivatives 
      compound C11, as well as the in vivo assessment of the impact on the neurogenesis 
      and cognitive functions of C11 and levetiracetam (LEV) after pilocarpine 
      (PILO)-induced SE in mice. The in vitro results indicated a protective effect of 
      C11 (500, 1000, and 2500 ng/mL) on astrocytes under trophic stress conditions in 
      the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) test. The 
      results obtained from the in vivo studies, where mice 72 h after PILO SE were 
      treated with C11 (20 mg/kg) and LEV (10 mg/kg), indicated markedly beneficial 
      effects of C11 on the improvement of the neurogenesis compared to the PILO 
      control and PILO LEV mice. Moreover, this beneficial effect was reflected in the 
      Morris Water Maze test evaluating the cognitive functions in mice. The in vitro 
      confirmed protective effect of C11 on astrocytes, as well as the in vivo 
      demonstrated beneficial impact on neurogenesis and cognitive functions, strongly 
      indicate the need for further advanced molecular research on this compound to 
      determine the exact neuroprotective mechanism of action of C11.

AB  - Alzheimer disease (AD) is an age related neurodegenerative disease causing severe 
      cognitive and memory decline in elderly people. Flavonoids play neuroprotective 
      role by inhibiting and/or modifying the self-assembly of the amyloid-β (Aβ) or 
      tau peptide into oligomers and fibrils. This study sought to investigate the 
      effect of hesperetin (HPT) on scopolamine-induced memory impairments in mice. 
      Mice were orally pretreated with HPT (1, 5 or 50 mg/kg) or vehicle (normal 
      saline; 10 ml/kg) for 3 consecutive days. One hour post-treatment on day 3, 
      scopolamine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 5 min before locomotor activity 
      (open field test) and memory function (novel object recognition test (NORT) for 2 
      consecutive days and Morris water maze task (MWM) for 5 consecutive days). Levels 
      of oxidative stress markers / brain derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) and 
      acetylcholinesterase activity were determined in the hippocampus and prefrontal 
      cortex after completion of MWM task. Scopolamine caused no significant change in 
      mice exploration of the familiar or novel object in the test session whereas the 
      HPT-treated mice spent more time exploring the novel object more than familiar 
      object in NORT. Scopolamine also increased the escape latency in acquisition 
      phase and decreases time spent in target quadrant in probe phase which were 
      ameliorated by the pretreatment with HPT. Scopolamine-induced alteration of 
      oxidant-antioxidant balance, acetylcholinesterase activity and neurogenesis in 
      the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were attenuated by HPT treatment. This 
      study showed that HPT ameliorated non-spatial/spatial learning and memory 
      impairment by scopolamine possibly through enhancement of antioxidant defense, 
      cholinergic and BDNF signaling.

      elderly. Currently available anti-AD drugs can only offer limited 
      symptom-relieving effects. "One-compound-Multitargeted Strategy" have been 
      recognized as the promising way to win the war against AD. Herein we report a 
      potential anti-AD agent PT109 with multi-functions. First, an 81-kinase screening 
      was carried out and results showed that PT109 potently inhibited c-Jun N-terminal 
      kinases and Serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1, which are the important 
      signaling molecules involved in neurogenesis, neuroprotection and 
      neuroinflammation and mildly inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3β as well as 
      protein kinase C gamma, both are involved in AD pathological processes. In 
      addition, invitro studies of immunofluorescent staining and Western blot showed 
      that PT109 might promote the neurogenesis of C17.2 cells and induce 
      synaptogenesis in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We detected and 
      confirmed the neuroprotective effect of PT109 in cultured HT22 cells by MTT 
      assay, dehydrogenase assay, glutathione assay and reactive oxygen species assay. 
      Furthermore, the results of Western blot, ELISA assay and immunofluorescent 
      staining indicated that PT109 attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation 
      in BV2 cells and primary astrocytes. The results of Morris water maze and 
      Step-through test indicated that PT109 improved the spatial learning ability in 
      APP/PS1 mice. More importantly, the invivo pharmacokinetic parameters indicated 
      that PT109 had better medicinal properties. Taken together, our findings suggest 
      that PT109 may be a promising candidate for treating AD through multiple targets 
      although further studies are ought to be conducted.

AB  - Phenotypic variation is a fundamental prerequisite for cell and organism 
      evolution by natural selection. Whereas the role of stochastic gene expression in 
      phenotypic diversity of genetically identical cells is well studied, not much is 
      known regarding the relationship between stochastic gene expression and 
      individual behavioral variation in animals. We demonstrate that a specific miRNA 
      (miR-466f-3p) is upregulated in the hippocampus of a portion of individual inbred 
      mice upon a Morris water maze task. Significantly, miR-466f-3p positively 
      regulates the neuron morphology, function and spatial learning, and memory 
      capability of mice. Mechanistically, miR-466f-3p represses translation of MEF2A, 
      a negative regulator of learning/memory. Finally, we show that varied 
      upregulation of hippocampal miR-466f-3p results from randomized phosphorylation 
      of hippocampal cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding (CREB) in individuals. 
      This finding of modulation of spatial learning and memory via a randomized 
      hippocampal signaling axis upon neuronal stimulation represents a demonstration 
      of how variation in tissue gene expression lead to varied animal behavior.

AB  - Environmental enrichment has been shown to increase cognitive abilities and 
      accelerate recovery from a number of disease states. Typically, enrichment 
      protocols last from four to eight weeks, however, it has previously been shown 
      that two weeks of environmental enrichment is sufficient to increase cognitive 
      abilities and the proliferation of the astroglial stem cell pool in juvenile 
      mice. The current study examines whether a short-term enrichment protocol can 
      induce similar effects in adults as compared to juveniles. Using juvenile and 
      adult wild-type mice, we examined the effects of short-term environmental 
      enrichment (including a running wheel) on cognitive abilities, anxiety-like 
      behaviour, and the stem cell potential of sub-ventricular neural stem cells 
      (NSC's) in vitro using neurosphere assays. We found that short-term environmental 
      enrichment decreased anxiety behaviour and increased overall memory abilities 
      similarly in juveniles and adults. However, the rate of acquisition on the Morris 
      water maze, hippocampal Sox2 and Ki67 expression, and neurosphere potential 
      increased in response to enrichment only in juveniles, suggesting that the 
      effects of enrichment on these measures are age dependant. Together, these data 
      suggest that the potential beneficial effects of environmental manipulations 
      decrease with age.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was investigate whether histopathological changes 
      in the neurogenic region correlate with appropriate cognitive impairment in the 
      experimental model of radiation-induced brain injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Adult male Wistar rats randomized into sham (0 Gy) and two experimental groups 
      (survived 30 and 100 days after treatment) received fractionated whole-brain 
      irradiation (one 5 Gy fraction/week for four weeks) with a total dose of 20 Gy of 
      gamma rays. Morris water maze cognitive testing, histochemistry, 
      immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used to determine whether the 
      cognitive changes are associated with the alteration of neurogenesis, astrocytic 
      response and activation of microglia along and/or adjacent to well-defined 
      pathway, subventricular zone-olfactory bulb axis (SVZ-OB axis). RESULTS: 
      Irradiation revealed altered cognitive functions usually at 100 days after 
      treatment. Neurodegenerative changes were characterized by a significant increase 
      of Fluoro-Jade-positive cells 30 days after irradiation accompanied by a steep 
      decline of neurogenesis 100 days after treatment. A strong astrocytic response 
      and upregulation of the activated microglia were seen in both of experimental 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Results shows that fractionated irradiation led to cognitive 
      impairment closely associated with accerelation of neuronal cell death, 
      inhibition of neurogenesis, activation of astrocytes and microglia indicate early 
      delayed radiation-induced changes.

AB  - The Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of 
      neurogenesis. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the Notch 
      signaling pathway was involved in the neurogenesis impairment and long-term 
      neurocognitive dysfunction caused by neonatal exposure to ketamine. On postnatal 
      day 7 (PND-7), male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were intraperitoneally injected with 
      40 mg/kg ketamine four consecutive times (40 mg/kg × 4) at 1-h intervals. Notch 
      ligand Jagged1 (0.5 mg/kg) and lentivirus overexpressing the Notch1 intracellular 
      domain (LV-NICD1) were microinjected into the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) 1 h 
      or 4 days before ketamine administration, respectively. The expression of Notch1 
      signaling pathway-related proteins was detected by Western blotting 24 h after 
      ketamine administration. The proliferation and differentiation of the neural stem 
      cells (NSCs) in the hippocampal DG were evaluated by double immunofluorescence 
      staining 24 h after treatment. Moreover, changes in hippocampus-dependent spatial 
      memory of 2-month-old rats were investigated with the Morris water maze test. 
      Ketamine anesthesia in neonatal rats decreased the expression levels of Jagged1, 
      Notch1, NICD1, and hairy enhancer of split 1 (Hes1); inhibited the proliferation 
      and astrocytic differentiation of NSCs; and promoted the differentiation of 
      neurons. Neonatal exposure to ketamine caused deficits in hippocampus-dependent 
      spatial reference memory tasks in 2-month-old rats. Microinjection of Jagged1 or 
      LV-NICD1 reversed the inhibitory effect of ketamine on the expression of 
      Notch1-related proteins in the hippocampal DG, attenuated the ketamine-mediated 
      decrease in NSC proliferation and differentiation, and improved the cognitive 
      function of 2-month-old rats after neonatal exposure to ketamine. These results 
      suggest that neonatal exposure to ketamine in rats inhibits the proliferation and 
      differentiation of hippocampal NSCs and impairs neurocognitive function in 
      adulthood. The Notch1 signaling pathway may be involved in the impairment of 
      hippocampus-dependent learning and memory during adulthood caused by neonatal 
      exposure to ketamine. These findings contribute to further understanding the 
      neurotoxicity induced by neonatal exposure to ketamine and the underlying 
      mechanisms.

AB  - Mental disorders have a multifactorial etiology and stress presents as one of the 
      causal factors. In depression, it is suggested that high cortisol concentration 
      contributes directly to the pathology of this disease. Based on that, the study 
      aims to evaluate the potential antidepressant effect of Riparin IV (Rip IV) in 
      mice submitted to chronic stress model by repeated corticosterone administration. 
      Female Swiss mice were selected into four groups: control (Ctrl), corticosterone 
      (Cort), Riparin IV (Cort + Rip IV) and fluvoxamine (Cort + Flu). Three groups 
      were administrated subcutaneously (SC) with corticosterone (20 mg/kg) during 
      twenty-one days, while the control group received only vehicle. After the 
      fourteenth day, groups were administrated tested drugs: Riparin IV, fluvoxamine 
      or distilled water, by gavage, 1 h after subcutaneous injections. After the final 
      treatment, animals were exposed to behavioral models such as forced swimming test 
      (FST), tail suspension test (TST), open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze 
      (EPM) and sucrose preference test (SPT). The hippocampus was also removed for the 
      determination of BDNF levels. Corticosterone treatment altered all parameters in 
      behavioral tests, leading to a depressive- and anxious-like behavior. Riparin IV 
      and fluvoxamine exhibit antidepressant effect in FST, TST and SPT. In EPM and 
      OFT, treatment displayed anxiolytic effect without alteration of locomotor 
      activity. Corticosterone administration decreased BDNF levels and Riparin IV 
      could reestablish them, indicating that its antidepressant effect may be related 
      to ability to ameliorate hippocampal neurogenesis. These findings suggest that 
      Riparin IV improves the depressive and anxious symptoms after chronic stress and 
      could be a new alternative treatment for patients with depression.

TI  - GSK-3β/mTORC1 Couples Synaptogenesis and Axonal Repair to Reduce Hypoxia 
      Ischemia-Mediated Brain Injury in Neonatal Rats.
PG  - 383-394
LID - 10.1093/jnen/nly015 [doi]
AB  - Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) plays an important role in neurological 
      outcomes after brain injury. However, its roles and mechanisms in 
      hypoxia-ischemia (HI) are unclear. Activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) has been 
      proven to induce the synthesis of proteins associated with regeneration. We 
      hypothesized that GSK-3β inhibition could activate the mTORC1 signaling pathway, 
      which may reduce axonal injury and induce synaptic protein synthesis and 
      functional recovery of synapses after HI. By analyzing a P7 rat model of cerebral 
      HI and an in vitro ischemic (oxygen glucose deprivation) model, we found that 
      GSK-3β inhibitors (GSK-3β siRNA or lithium chloride) activated mTORC1 signaling, 
      leading to increased expression of synaptic proteins, including synapsin 1, 
      PSD95, and GluR1, and the microtubule-associated protein Tau and decreased 
      expression of the axonal injury-associated protein amyloid precursor protein. 
      These changes contributed to attenuated axonal injury (decreased amyloid 
      precursor protein staining and axonal loss by silver staining), improved 
      electrophysiological properties of synapses, and enhanced spatial memory 
      performance in the Morris water maze. However, inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin 
      blocked the benefits induced by GSK-3β inhibition, suggesting that GSK-3β 
      inhibition induces synaptogenesis and axonal repair via mTORC1 signaling, which 
      may benefit neonatal rats subjected to HI.

      hippocampus].
PG  - 375-383
LID - 10.3760/cma.j.cn112144-20220214-00059 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: To study the effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) injected 
      through tail vein on the molecular expression levels of biomarkers of neural stem 
      cells (NSC) and neurons in the hippocampus of wild-type adult rats, and the 
      effects on hippocampal neurogenesis. Methods: Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley (SD) 
      rats were randomly divided into 3 groups based on the table of random numbers 
      (n=6 in each group). In low-intensity group and high-intensity group, rats were 
      injected intravenously through tail vein with 200 μl Pg ATCC33277 [1.0×10(3) and 
      1.0×10(8) colony forming unit (CFU), respectively] 3 times per week for 8 weeks. 
      In the sham group, 200 μl of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) was given instead. 
      Behavioral tests: the navigation and the exploration tests using Morris water 
      maze (MWM) were applied to evaluate learning and memory ability of rats. 
      Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect cells positively expressing nestin, 
      doublecortin (DCX) and neuronal nuclei (NeuN) in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of 
      rats in each group. Western blotting was used to evaluate the expression levels 
      of nestin, DCX and NeuN in rat hippocampus. Results: Learning and memory 
      abilities: on day 5 of navigation test, the lagency time was 22.83 (16.00, 38.34) 
      s in the high-intensity group, significantly longer than the sham group [5.59 
      (5.41, 6.17) s] (t=-11.17, P<0.001). There were no significant differences 
      between the low-intensity group [9.85 (8.75, 21.01) s] and the sham group 
      (t=-6.83, P=0.080). Results in the exploration test showed that, in the 
      high-intensity group, the number of fime crossing over the previous platform area 
      within 60 s was 1.50 (1.00, 2.00), significantly less than the sham group [4.00 
      (2.75, 4.00)] (t=9.75, P=0.003); no significant differences between the 
      low-intensity group [2.50 (2.00, 3.00)] and the sham one (t=4.50, P=0.382). 
      Immunohistochemistry showed that the nestin(+) cell density in the low-intensity 
      group [(35.36±4.32) cell/mm(2)] and high-intensity group [(26.51±5.89) 
      cell/mm(2)] were significantly lower than the sham group [(59.58±14.15) 
      cell/mm(2)] (t=24.21, P=0.018; t=33.07, P=0.005); as for the mean absorbance of 
      DCX(+) cells, the low-intensity group (0.007±0.002) and the high-intensity group 
      (0.006±0.002) were significantly lower than the sham group (0.011±0.001) 
      (t=0.004, P=0.018; t=0.006, P=0.005); compared with the sham group 
      [(1.13±0.14)×10(3) cell/mm(2)], the density of NeuN(+) neurons in the 
      high-intensity group [(0.75±0.08)×10(3) cell/mm(2)] was significantly reduced 
      (t=0.38, P=0.017), and was not significantly changed in the low-intensity group 
      [(0.88±0.19)×10(3) cell/mm(2)] (t=0.25, P=0.075). Western blotting results showed 
      that, compared with the sham group, the expression levels of nestin, DCX, and 
      NeuN were significantly reduced in the high-intensity group (t=0.74, P<0.001; 
      t=0.18, P=0.014; t=0.35, P=0.008), but were not statistically changed in the 
      low-intensity group (t=0.18, P=0.108; t=0.08, P=0.172; t=0.19, P=0.077). 
      Conclusions: Pg injected through tail vein may reduce learning and memory 
      abilities of wild-type rats, and may reduce the number of nestin, DCX, and 
      NeuN-positive cells, and the protein expression levels of the above molecules in 
      the hippocampus.

AB  - Menopause is associated with cognitive decline, and hormone therapies (HTs) may 
      improve cognition depending on type and timing of HTs. Previous parity may 
      influence cognition in later life. We investigated how primiparity and long-term 
      ovariectomy influence cognition, neurogenesis, hormones, cytokines, and neuronal 
      activation in middle-aged rats in response to Premarin, an HT. Nulliparous and 
      primiparous rats were sham-ovariectomized or ovariectomized, administered vehicle 
      or Premarin 6 months later, and all rats were trained in the Morris water maze. 
      Premarin improved early spatial learning and memory in nulliparous rats but 
      impaired early learning in primiparous rats. With training, primiparity increased 
      hippocampal neurogenesis, and Premarin decreased immature neurons, regardless of 
      parity. Moreover, Premarin increased serum tumor necrosis factor α and the CXC 
      chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) in trained nulliparous, but not primiparous, rats. 
      However, Premarin decreased the expression of the immediate early gene zif268 in 
      the dorsal CA3 region in primiparous rats after training. Thus, primiparity 
      alters how Premarin affects spatial learning, neuronal activation, and serum 
      cytokines. These findings have implications for the treatment of age-associated 
      cognitive decline in women.

TI  - Leaf extracts from Dendropanax morbifera Léveille mitigate mercury-induced 
      reduction of spatial memory, as well as cell proliferation, and neuroblast 
      differentiation in rat dentate gyrus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The brain is susceptible to methylmercury toxicity, which causes 
      irreversible damage to neurons and glia and the leaf extract Dendropanax 
      morbifera Léveille (DML) has various biological functions in the nervous system. 
      In this study, we examined the effects of DML on mercury-induced proliferating 
      cells and differentiated neuroblasts. METHODS: Dimethylmercury (5 μg/kg) and 
      galantamine (5 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally and/or DML (100 mg/kg) 
      was orally to 7-week-old rats every day for 36 days. One hour after the 
      treatment, novel object recognition test was examined. In addition, spatial probe 
      tests were conducted on the 6th day after 5 days of continuous training in the 
      Morris swim maze. Thereafter, the rats were euthanized for immunohistochemical 
      staining analysis with Ki67 and doublecortin and measurement for 
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. RESULTS: Dimethylmercury-treated rats 
      showed reduced discrimination index in novel object recognition test and took 
      longer to find the platform than did control group. Compared with dimethylmercury 
      treatment alone, supplementation with DML or galatamine significantly ameliorated 
      the reduction of discrimination index and reduced the time spent to find the 
      platform. In addition, the number of platform crossings was lower in the 
      dimethylmercury-treated group than in controls, while the administration of DML 
      or galantamine significantly increased the number of crossings than did 
      dimethylmercury treatment alone. Proliferating cells and differentiated 
      neuroblasts, assessed by Ki67 and doublecortin immunohistochemical staining was 
      significantly decreased in the dimethylmercury treated group versus controls. 
      Supplementation with DML or galantamine significantly increased the number of 
      proliferating cells and differentiated neuroblasts in the dentate gyrus. In 
      addition, treatment with dimethylmercury significantly increased AChE activity in 
      hippocampal homogenates, while treatment with dimethylmercury+DML or 
      dimethylmercury+galantamine significantly ameliorated this increase. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These results suggest that DML may be a functional food that improves 
      dimethylmercury-induced memory impairment and ameliorates dimethylmercury-induced 
      reduction in proliferating cells and differentiated neuroblasts, and demonstrates 
      corresponding activation of AChE activity in the dentate gyrus.

TI  - Exposure to Short Photoperiod Regime Restores Spatial Cognition in Ventral 
      Subicular Lesioned Rats: Potential Role of Hippocampal Plasticity, Glucocorticoid 
      Receptors, and Neurogenesis.
PG  - 4437-4459

AB  - Ambient light influences our mood, behavior, and cognition. Phototherapy has been 
      considered as an effective non-pharmacological intervention strategy in the 
      restoration of cognitive functions following central nervous system insults. 
      However, the cellular and molecular underpinnings of phototherapy-mediated 
      functional recovery are yet to be studied. The present study examines the 
      effectiveness of short photoperiod regime (SPR; 6:18-h light:dark cycle) in 
      restoring the cognitive functions in ventral subicular lesioned rats. Bilateral 
      ventral subicular lesion (VSL) resulted in significant impairment of spatial 
      navigational abilities when tested in the Morris water maze (MWM) task. Further, 
      VSL resulted in reduced expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and 
      activity-regulated cytoskeletal (Arc) protein and suppression of neurogenesis in 
      the hippocampus. VSL also suppressed the magnitude of long-term potentiation 
      (LTP) in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. However, exposure to 
      SPR for 21 days showed significant restoration of spatial performance in the MWM 
      task as the ventral subicular lesioned rats could deploy higher cognitive 
      allocentric navigational strategies to reach the hidden platform. Further, SPR 
      resulted in enhanced expression of hippocampal GR and Arc protein and 
      neurogenesis but not hippocampal LTP suggestive of appropriate need-based SPR 
      intervention. In conclusion, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of SPR in 
      establishing functional recovery as well as the possible molecular and cellular 
      basis of cognitive recovery in a rat model of neurodegeneration. Such studies 
      provide a framework in understanding the efficacy of non-pharmacological 
      strategies in establishing functional recovery in neurodegenerative conditions.

TI  - The experimental research on neuroplasticity in rats' hippocampus subjected to 
      chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and interfered by Modified Dioscorea Pills.
PG  - e02897

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion (CCH) is a common, crucial and tough 
      problem for old people. It easily leads to Lacunar Infarction and even Vascular 
      Dementia (VD). Western medicine has the advantage to relieve some VD symptoms but 
      fails to cure it. Some classic Chinese medicines have good efficacies to treat 
      and delay the cerebral functional decline resulted from CCH. Among them Modified 
      Dioscorea Pills (MDP) has been proven to have a convincing effect in curing VD. 
      So far the knowledge about neuroplasticity in CCH is little known and the 
      underlying interfered mechanism by MDP on neuroplasticity has not yet been 
      explored. This study explores the changes of neuroplasticity involving 
      neurogenesis, angiogenesis and synaptogenesis in CCH and interfered by MDP. 
      METHODS: 40 male SD rats were divided into the Sham operated Group, the Model 
      Group and the MDP Group according to a Random Number Table. Bilateral Common 
      Carotid Arteries Occlusion (BCCAO) was adopted to prepare CCH models. MDP 
      condense decoction had been administered by gavage to rats in the MDP Group 
      (10g·Kg-1·d-1) for 45 days; Rats in the other two groups were accepted normal 
      salts as substitution with same dosage and course. Through Morris Water Maze 
      (MWM) test, pathological observation of hippocampus, ultrastructural study on 
      synapse, Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry 
      detection, the capacities of intelligence of rats, the morphological character of 
      hippocampus CA1 zone and the synapse associated protein and gene such as Growth 
      Associated Protein (GAP-43) mRNA, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) mRNA, 
      Microtubule-associated Protein (MAP)-2, Synaptophysin (SYP), Postsynaptic Density 
      protein (PSD)-95 and Micro Vessel Density (MVD) were determined. Through one-way 
      ANOVA the data was analyzed and when P＜0.05 the result was considered 
      significant. RESULTS: Compared to the Model Group, rats in the MDP Group achieved 
      much better behavioral performance (P＜0.05); more neurons and more synapses 
      regenerated; the expression of SYP, PSD-95and MAP-2 up-regulated (P＜0.05); The 
      expressions of GAP-43 mRNA and VEGF mRNA in the Model Group were higher than 
      those in the Sham operated Group (P＜0.05), but they reached the highest in the 
      MDP Group (P＜0.05); The count of MVD in the Sham operated Group is the lowest, it 
      is higher in the MDP Group and it reaches highest in the Model Group (P＜0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Some key genes promoting neuroplasticity such as GAP-43 mRNA and 
      VEGF mRNA remarkably up-regulated in CCH, they only boost angiogenesis but fail 
      to facilitate neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in CCH. However, accompanied by 
      furtherly up-regulation of these two key genes, MDP obviously improves 
      neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and temperate angiogenesis in CCH which may be 
      underlying its good efficacy.

TI  - Adolescent Alcohol Exposure Produces Protracted Cognitive-Behavioral Impairments

AB  - Binge drinking is common in adolescence. Rodent studies modeling adolescent binge 
      drinking find persistent effects on the brain's physiology, including increased 
      expression of neuroimmune genes, impaired neurogenesis, and changes in behavioral 
      flexibility. This study used females and males to investigate the effects of 
      adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) on a battery of behaviors assessing spatial 
      navigation using a radial arm water maze, working memory using the Hebb-Williams 
      maze, non-spatial long-term memory using novel object recognition, and dominance 
      using a tube dominance test. Results indicate that AIE impairs adult acquisition 
      in spatial navigational learning with deficits predominantly driven by females. 
      Surprisingly, AIE slowed the transition from random to serial search strategies 
      in both sexes, suggesting AIE impairs flexibility in problem-solving processing. 
      In the Hebb-Williams maze working memory task, adult AIE rats exhibited deficits 
      in problem solving, resulting in more errors across the 12 maze configurations, 
      independent of sex. Conversely, AIE decreased dominance behaviors in female rats, 
      and at 7 months post-alcohol, female AIE rats continued to exhibit deficits in 
      novel object recognition. These results suggest that cognitive-behavioral 
      alterations after adolescent binge drinking persist well into middle age, despite 
      abstinence. Future studies should focus on intervening treatment strategies in 
      both females and males.

AB  - Polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene confer a major genetic risk for 
      the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are predictive of 
      outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Alterations in adult hippocampal 
      neurogenesis have long been associated with both the development of AD and 
      recovery following TBI and ApoE is known to play a role in this process. In order 
      to determine how ApoE might influence hippocampal injury-induced neurogenesis, we 
      generated a conditional knockout system whereby functional ApoE from astrocytes 
      was ablated prior to injury. While successfully ablating ApoE just prior to TBI 
      in mice, we observed an attenuation in the development of the spines in the 
      newborn neurons. Intriguingly, animals with a double-hit, i.e. injury and ApoE 
      conditionally inactivated in astrocytes, demonstrated the most pronounced 
      impairments in the hippocampal-dependent Morris water maze test, failing to 
      exhibit spatial memory after both acquisition and reversal training trials. In 
      comparison, conditional knockout mice without injury displayed impairments but 
      only in the reversal phase of the test, suggesting accumulative effects of 
      astrocytic ApoE deficiency and traumatic brain injury on AD-like phenotypes. 
      Together, these findings demonstrate that astrocytic ApoE is required for 
      functional injury-induced neurogenesis following traumatic brain injury.

      neurogenesis impairment in late-onset depression].
PG  - 6231-6242

AB  - This study aims to elucidate the underlying mechanism of Erxian Decoction(EXD) 
      against neurogenesis impairment in late-onset depression(LOD) rats based on 
      cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) proteomics. A total of 66 20-21-month-old male Wistar 
      rats were randomized into naturally aged(AGED) group, LOD group, and EXD group. 
      All rats received chronic unpredictable mild stress(CUMS) for 6 weeks for LOD 
      modeling except for the AGED group. During the modeling, EXD group was given 
      EXD(ig, twice a day at 4 g·kg~(-1)) and other groups received equivalent amount 
      of normal saline(ig). After modeling, a series of behavioral tests, such as 
      sucrose preference test(SPT), open-field test(OFT), forced swimming test(FST), 
      and Morris water maze test(MWMT) were performed. Immunofluorescence method was 
      used to detect the number of Ki-67/Nesti-positive cells and BrdU/DCX-positive 
      cells in the hippocampal DG area of each group. High-concentration 
      corticosterone(CORT) was combined with D-galactose(D-gal) to simulate the changes 
      of LOD-related stress and aging and the proliferation and differentiation of 
      primary neural stem cells of hippocampus in each group were observed. Data 
      independent acquisition(DIA)-mass spectrometry(MS) was used to analyze the 
      differential proteins in CSF among groups and bioinformatics analysis was 
      performed to explore the biological functions of the proteins. Behavioral tests 
      showed that sucrose consumption in SPT, total traveling distance in OFT, and 
      times of crossing the platform in MWMT were all reduced(P&lt;0.01) and the 
      immobility time in FST was prolonged(P&lt;0.01) in the LOD group compared with 
      those in the AGED group, suggesting that LOD rats had developed depression 
      symptoms such as anhedonia, decreased locomotor activity ability, and cognitive 
      dysfunction. Behavioral abnormalities were alleviated(P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.05) in 
      the EXD group as compared with those in the LOD group. Immunofluorescence results 
      demonstrated that Ki-67/Nesti-positive cells and BrdU/DCX-positive cells in the 
      hippocampal DG area were fewer(P&lt;0.05) in LOD group than in the AGED group, 
      and the positive cells in the EXD group were more(P&lt;0.05) than those in the 
      LOD group. In vitro experiment showed that the proliferation and differentiation 
      of primary hippocampal neural stem cells under the CORT+D-gal treatment were 
      reduced(P&lt;0.01). The proliferation rate of neural stem cells 
      decreased(P&lt;0.05) in CORT+D-gal+LOD-CSF group but increased(P&lt;0.01) in 
      CORT+D-gal+EXD-CSF group compared with that in the CORT+D-gal group. A total of 2 
      620 proteins were identified from rat CSF, with 135 differential proteins between 
      the LOD group and AGED group and 176 between EXD group and LOD group. GDF11, 
      NrCAM, NTRK2, and GhR were related to neurogenesis and 39 differential proteins 
      were regulated by both LOD and EXD. EXD demonstrated obvious anti-LOD effect, as 
      it improved the locomotor activity ability and cognitive function of LOD rats and 
      protected the proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal neural stem cells. 
      EXD exerts anti-LOD effect by regulating the proteins related to neurogenesis in 
      CSF, such as GDF11, NrCAM, NTRK2, and GhR and maintaining hippocampal 
      neurogenesis.

AB  - Xiaoshuan enteric-coated capsule (XSEC) is a Chinese medicinal compound widely 
      used for treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. Enriched environment 
      (EE) is an effective rehabilitative protocol designed to enhance sensorimotor, 
      cognitive and social stimulation. This study aimed to apply magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) to non-invasively assess whether EE could augment the therapeutic 
      benefits of XSEC on post-ischemic neurovascular remodeling. Male Sprague-Dawley 
      rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and 
      treated with XSEC and EE alone or combination for 30 consecutive days. Beam 
      walking test and Morris water maze (MWM) test were performed to evaluate motor 
      and cognitive function, respectively. Multimodal MRI was applied to examine 
      alterations to brain structures, intracranial vessels, and cerebral perfusion on 
      the 31st day after MCAO. Double-immunofluorescent staining was used to evaluate 
      neurogenesis and angiogenesis. Western blot and RT-PCR were used to detect the 
      expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), 
      angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), and the axon guidance molecules. Combination therapy with 
      XSEC and EE significantly reduced cystic volume compared with XSEC and EE 
      monotherapies. In line with this, combination treated rats performed better in 
      the beam walking test and exhibited improved spatial memory in the probe trial of 
      the MWM. Moreover, XSEC and EE combination treatment improved cerebral blood flow 
      (CBF), amplified angiogenesis and upregulated VEGF protein levels. This 
      proangiogenic effect was consistent with the increased progenitor cell 
      proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the peri-infarct cortex and 
      striatum. Specifically, the combined therapy of XSEC and EE markedly increased 
      the Netrin-1 and Robo-1 protein expression levels compared with vehicle group, 
      while no difference was observed between XSEC or EE monotherapy and vehicle 
      group. Together, these findings indicate that the combination of XSEC and EE 
      benefits neurovascular reorganization. This correlates with restoration of CBF, 
      promotion of neurogenesis and angiogenesis, and activation of the intrinsic 
      axonal guidance molecules, thereby facilitating greater physical rehabilitation 
      after ischemic stroke.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely associated with neuroinflammation development 
      in the brain. Co-delivery of metformin (MET) with phosphatidylserine liposomes 
      neuroprotectant may be beneficial in ameliorating AD-related symptoms like memory 
      impairment and inflammation. Therefore, we aimed to prepare metformin containing 
      phosphatidylserine nanoliposomes formulation (MET-PSL) and to evaluate its effect 
      on rats subjected to AD. Alzheimer's disease model was induced by bilateral 
      intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (3 mg/kg) into rat brains 
      using the stereotactic technique. MET-PSL, MET, and PSL alone were administered 
      intraperitoneally to AD-induced animals and factors including learning and memory 
      storage in addition to cytokine and tissue inflammatory changes were evaluated 
      after a 22-day experiment period. The learning and memory parameters 
      significantly (P < 0.05) improved in AD-rats treated with MET-PSL. Moreover, 
      MET-PSL administration significantly (P < 0.05) decreased cytokine levels of 
      IL1-β, TNF-α, and TGF-β in hippocampal tissues of rats with AD. Histological 
      results indicated a considerable reduction in inflammatory and necrotic neural 
      cells along with significantly (P < 0.05) increased neurogenesis in MET-PSL 
      treated rats. Furthermore, our results showed that MET-PSL formulation could 
      potentially act better than the free form of MET and PSL alone in the recovery 
      process of rats with AD. In general, our data suggest that combination therapy of 
      metformin loaded phosphatidylserine liposomes may enhance the therapeutic 
      performance in AD patients of a clinical study.

TI  - Key mechanisms underlying netrin-1 prevention of impaired spatial and object 
      memory in Aβ(1-42) CA1-injected rats.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with an incompletely 
      defined aetiology that is associated with memory and cognitive impairment. 
      Currently available therapeutics only provide temporary assistance with symptoms. 
      In spite of plentiful research in the field and the generation of thousands of 
      studies, much is still to be clarified on precise mechanisms of pathobiology, 
      prevention modalities, disease course and cure. Netrin-1, a laminin family 
      protein, is said to have anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects and has a 
      key role in neurogenesis and morphogenesis of neural structures. Accordingly, 
      this study was designed to investigate protective effects of bilateral 
      intrahippocampal fissure microinjections of netrin-1 on memory impairment in rat 
      model of AD. Concomitant administration of netrin-1 with amyloid beta 1-42 
      (Aβ(1-42) ) improved cognitive dysfunction in novel object recognition task 
      (NOR), ameliorated impaired spatial memory in Morris water maze (MWM) setting, 
      increased neuronal density and reduced amyloid aggregation in rat AD model. 
      Netrin-1 was also seen to prevent Aβ(1-42) -induced caspase-3, caspase-7 and 
      NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) 
      activation. Therefore, based on the data reported here, netrin-1 may be a 
      promising biologic therapeutic that addresses the memory and neuronal loss 
      associated with AD.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by 
      the irreversible neuronal loss and memory impairment, and current treatments are 
      merely symptomatic. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to possess neurotrophic, 
      neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and memory-enhancing effects, which could be 
      therapeutically beneficial in the different aspects of AD. However, the 
      hematopoietic effect of EPO has hampered its potential as a neuroprotective and 
      procognitive agent. In this study, we characterized a novel small peptide, NL100, 
      derived from a conserved C-helix region of EPO. NL100 was shown to bind to the 
      EPO receptor, induce neuritogenesis, and protect hippocampal neurons from 
      oxidative- and Aβ(25-35)-induced neurodegeneration in vitro. Importantly, 
      long-term NL100 treatment did not induce hematopoiesis, overcoming this challenge 
      associated with EPO. Memory-enhancing effects were demonstrated after NL100 
      treatment in social recognition test for short-term memory, in both healthy rats 
      and rats challenged centrally with Aβ(25-35) peptide, and in the Morris water 
      maze test for spatial memory. Moreover, NL100 was shown to reverse 
      Aβ(25-35)-induced hippocampal degeneration and gliosis as well as 
      pilocarpine-induced suppression of long-term potentiation in rats. In conclusion, 
      NL100 is a novel EPO-derived nonhematopoietic peptide with neuroprotective and 
      memory-enhancing effects and could therefore be a potential candidate for the 
      development of new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders and dementia.

TI  - Effects of Maternal Chewing on Prenatal Stress-Induced Cognitive Impairments in 
      the Offspring via Multiple Molecular Pathways.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21165627 [doi]
LID - 5627
AB  - We aimed to investigate the effects of maternal chewing on prenatal 
      stress-induced cognitive impairments in the offspring and to explore the 
      molecular pathways of maternal chewing in a mice model. Maternal chewing 
      ameliorated spatial learning impairments in the offspring in a Morris water maze 
      test. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot findings revealed that maternal 
      chewing alleviated hippocampal neurogenesis impairment and increased the 
      expression of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the offspring. In 
      addition, maternal chewing increased the expression of glucocorticoid receptor 
      (GR) and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isozyme 2 (11β-HSD2) and decreased the 
      expression of 11β-HSD1 in the placenta, thereby attenuating the increase of 
      glucocorticoid in the offspring. Furthermore, maternal chewing increased the 
      expression of 11β-HSD2, FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) and FKBP52 and 
      decreased the expression of 11β-HSD1, thereby increasing hippocampal nuclear GR 
      level. In addition, maternal chewing attenuated the increase in expression of 
      DNMT1 and DNMT3a and the decrease in expression of histone H3 methylation at 
      lysine 4, 9, 27 and histone H3 acetylation at lysine 9 induced by prenatal stress 
      in the offspring. Our findings suggest that maternal chewing could ameliorate 
      prenatal stress-induced cognitive impairments in the offspring at least in part 
      by protecting placenta barrier function, alleviating hippocampal nuclear GR 
      transport impairment and increasing the hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor (BDNF) level.

AB  - Stromal cell-derived factor-1 and its receptor CXCR4 are essential regulators of 
      the neurogenesis that occurs in the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus. However, the 
      effects of CXCR7, a new atypical receptor of stromal cell-derived factor-1, on 
      hippocampal neurogenesis after a stroke remain largely unknown. Our study is the 
      first to investigate the effect of a CXCR7-neutralizing antibody on neurogenesis 
      in the dentate gyrus and the associated recovery of cognitive function of rats in 
      the chronic stage of cerebral ischemia. The rats were randomly divided into sham, 
      sham + anti-CXCR7, ischemia and ischemia + anti-CXCR7 groups. Endothelin-1 was 
      injected in the ipsilateral motor cortex and striatum to induce focal cerebral 
      ischemia. Sham group rats were injected with saline instead of endothelin-1 via 
      intracranial injection. Both sham and ischemic rats were treated with 
      intraventricular infusions of CXCR7-neutralizing antibodies for 6 days 1 week 
      after surgery. Immunofluorescence staining with doublecortin, a marker for 
      neuronal precursors, was performed to assess the neurogenesis in the dentate 
      gyrus. We found that anti-CXCR7 antibody infusion enhanced the proliferation and 
      dendritic development of doublecortin-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus in both 
      ischemic and sham-operated rats. Spatial learning and memory functions were 
      assessed by Morris water maze tests 30-32 days after ischemia. CXCR7-neutralizing 
      antibody treatment significantly reduced the escape latency of the spatial 
      navigation trial and increased the time spent in the target quadrant of spatial 
      probe trial in animals that received ischemic insult, but not in sham operated 
      rats. These results suggest that CXCR7-neutralizing antibody enhances the 
      neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and improves the cognitive function after 
      cerebral ischemia in rats. All animal experimental protocols and procedures were 
      approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of China Medical 
      University (CMU16089R) on December 8, 2016.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach for 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, poor engraftment and limited survival rates 
      are major obstacles for its clinical application. Resveratrol, an activator of 
      silent information regulator 2, homolog 1 (SIRT1), regulates cell destiny and is 
      beneficial for neurodegenerative disorders. The present study is designed to 
      explore whether resveratrol regulates the fate of human umbilical cord-derived 
      mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) and whether hUC-MSCs combined with resveratrol 
      would be efficacious in the treatment of neurodegeneration in a mouse model of AD 
      through SIRT1 signaling. Herein, we report that resveratrol facilitates hUC-MSCs 
      engraftment in the hippocampus of AD mice and resveratrol enhances the 
      therapeutic effects of hUC-MSCs in this model as demonstrated by improved 
      learning and memory in the Morris water maze, enhanced neurogenesis and 
      alleviated neural apoptosis in the hippocampus of the AD mice. Moreover, hUC-MSCs 
      and resveratrol jointly regulate expression of hippocampal SIRT1, PCNA, p53, 
      ac-p53, p21, and p16. These data strongly suggests that hUC-MSCs transplantation 
      combined with resveratrol may be an effective therapy for AD.

TI  - Ketamine Alters Hippocampal Cell Proliferation and Improves Learning in Mice 
      after Traumatic Brain Injury.
PG  - 278-295
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000002197 [doi]
AB  - WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: 
      BACKGROUND:: Traumatic brain injury induces cellular proliferation in the 
      hippocampus, which generates new neurons and glial cells during recovery. This 
      process is regulated by N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors, which are 
      inhibited by ketamine. The authors hypothesized that ketamine treatment after 
      traumatic brain injury would reduce hippocampal cell proliferation, leading to 
      worse behavioral outcomes in mice. METHODS: Traumatic brain injury was induced in 
      mice using a controlled cortical impact injury, after which mice (N = 118) 
      received either ketamine or vehicle systemically for 1 week. The authors utilized 
      immunohistochemical assays to evaluate neuronal, astroglial, and microglial cell 
      proliferation and survival 3 days, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks postintervention. The 
      Morris water maze reversal task was used to assess cognitive recovery. RESULTS: 
      Ketamine dramatically increased microglial proliferation in the granule cell 
      layer of the hippocampus 3 days after injury (injury + vehicle, 2,800 ± 2,700 
      cells/mm, n = 4; injury + ketamine, 11,200 ± 6,600 cells/mm, n = 6; P = 0.012). 
      Ketamine treatment also prevented the production of astrocytes 2 weeks after 
      injury (sham + vehicle, 2,400 ± 3,200 cells/mm, n = 13; injury + vehicle, 
      10,500 ± 11,300 cells/mm, n = 12; P = 0.013 vs. sham + vehicle; sham + ketamine, 
      3,500 ± 4,900 cells/mm, n = 14; injury + ketamine, 4,800 ± 3,000 cells/mm, n = 
      13; P = 0.955 vs. sham + ketamine). Independent of injury, ketamine temporarily 
      reduced neurogenesis (vehicle-exposed, 105,100 ± 66,700, cells/mm, n = 25; 
      ketamine-exposed, 74,300 ± 29,200 cells/mm, n = 27; P = 0.031). Ketamine 
      administration improved performance in the Morris water maze reversal test after 
      injury, but had no effect on performance in sham-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Ketamine alters hippocampal cell proliferation after traumatic brain injury. 
      Surprisingly, these changes were associated with improvement in a 
      neurogenesis-related behavioral recall task, suggesting a possible benefit from 
      ketamine administration after traumatic brain injury in mice. Future studies are 
      needed to determine generalizability and mechanism.

      High-Fat High-Sucrose Diet-Induced Metabolic Dysfunction and Spatial Learning 
      Deficits in Aging Mice.
PG  - 469-478

AB  - Aging and lifestyle factors, including high-sugar and high-fat diets, promote a 
      systemic metabolic imbalance that promotes neurodegeneration. Hericium erinaceus 
      has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine. Recently, its functional 
      activities, such as antimetabolic dysfunction, antineuroinflammatory activities, 
      and stimulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis, have been revealed. This 
      study demonstrated that Hericium erinaceus mycelium (HEM) and an isolated 
      diterpenoid derivative, erinacine A (EA), may reverse spatial learning 
      disabilities in aging mice (15 months old) fed with a high-fat and high-sucrose 
      diet (HFSD). Aging mice were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: 
      (1) a chow diet (control), (2) an HFSD, and an HFSD supplemented with either (3) 
      HEM or (4) EA for 18 weeks. The Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze were used for 
      behavioral assessments. Both HEM- and EA-treated mice had shorter mean daily 
      escape latencies than HFSD-treated mice in the MWM. In addition, HEM-treated mice 
      had a slightly increased exploratory time and frequency in the novel arm in the 
      Y-maze. Quantitative PCR revealed that both HEM- and EA-treated mice exhibited 
      reduced messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, 
      interleukin-1β, and HEM-treated mice exhibited increased mRNA expression of NGF 
      and NeuN in the hippocampus. Moreover, HEM and EA also decreased body weight, 
      abdominal fat, plasma glucose, serum and liver total cholesterol, and liver 
      triacylglycerol. Thus, HEM may be a potential health-promoting supplement for 
      minimizing the progression of aging and obesity-induced neurodegeneration by 
      reducing metabolic abnormalities and neuroinflammatory cytokines and increasing 
      neurogenesis factors.

AB  - Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) can improve the learning 
      and memory impairment of rats with Alzheimer's disease, however, its effect on 
      cerebral ischemia remains poorly understood. In this study, we established rat 
      models of middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion. One day after modeling, a 
      group of rats were treated with ELF-EMF (50 Hz, 1 mT) for 2 hours daily on 28 
      successive days. Our results showed that rats treated with ELF-EMF required 
      shorter swimming distances and latencies in the Morris water maze test than those 
      of untreated rats. The number of times the platform was crossed and the time 
      spent in the target quadrant were greater than those of untreated rats. The 
      number of BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) cells, representing newly born neurons, in the 
      hippocampal subgranular zone increased more in the treated than in untreated 
      rats. Up-regulation in the expressions of Notch1, Hes1, and Hes5 proteins, which 
      are the key factors of the Notch signaling pathway, was greatest in the treated 
      rats. These findings suggest that ELF-EMF can enhance hippocampal neurogenesis of 
      rats with cerebral ischemia, possibly by affecting the Notch signaling pathway. 
      The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Sichuan 
      University, China (approval No. 2019255A) on March 5, 2019.

TI  - Intranasal wnt-3a alleviates neuronal apoptosis in early brain injury post 
      subarachnoid hemorrhage via the regulation of wnt target PPAN mediated by the 
      moonlighting role of aldolase C.

AB  - Neuronal apoptosis is one of the main pathophysiological events in the early 
      brain injury (EBI) post subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Wnt-3a, one of the 
      endogenous wnt ligands crucial in neurogenesis, has been proven to be efficacious 
      in neuroprotection in traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke. The glycolytic 
      enzyme aldolase C and ribosome biogenesis protein PPAN were revealed to be linked 
      to wnt signaling pathway. The aim of the study was to explore the antiapoptotic 
      effects of intranasal wnt-3a through Frizzled-1 (Frz-1)/aldolase C/PPAN pathway 
      in SAH. Approaches for assessment included SAH grade, Garcia test, brain water 
      content evaluation, rotarod test, Morris water maze test, Western blot, 
      immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that 
      wnt-3a improved the neurological scores, brain water content and long-term 
      neurobehavioral functions after SAH. Wnt-3a increased the level of Frz-1, 
      aldolase C, β-catenin, PPAN and the Bcl-2/Bax ratio; and decreased the level of 
      axin and cleaved caspase-3 (CC-3). The anti-apoptotic effect of wnt-3a was 
      further evidenced by TUNEL staining and subcellular structure imaging. Frz-1 
      siRNA and aldolase C siRNA offset the effects of wnt-3a; and restoration of 
      aldolase C by aldolase C CRISPR in Frz-1 siRNA preconditioned SAH rats salvaged 
      the level of Frz-1, aldolase C, PPAN and reduced axin and CC-3. In summary, 
      intranasal administration of wnt-3a alleviates neuronal apoptosis through 
      Frz-1/aldolase C/PPAN pathway in the EBI of SAH rats. The feasible intranasal 
      route and the long-lasting neuroprotective property of wnt-3a is of great 
      clinical relevance.

TI  - Effects of TRPM7/miR-34a Gene Silencing on Spatial Cognitive Function and 
      Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Mice with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the effects of transient receptor potential 
      melastatin 7 (TRPM7)/microRNA-34a (miR-34a) gene silencing on spatial cognitive 
      function and hippocampal neurogenesis in mice with type 1 diabetes mellitus 
      (T1DM). BALB/c mice were chosen to establish T1DM models and divided into five 
      groups respectively: the negative control (NC), T1DM, T1DM + si-TRPM7, 
      T1DM + si-miR-34a, and T1DM + si-TRPM7 + si-miR-34a groups. Morris water maze 
      (MWM) test was adopted to observe behavioral alterations in mice. In all groups, 
      changes in weight, fasting insulin, blood glucose, and insulin-related 
      antibodies: insulin autoantibody (IAA), islet cell antibody (ICA), and glutamic 
      acid decarboxylase antibody (GAD-Ab) were monitored. Quantitative real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed to test TRPM7 and miR-34a 
      expressions. Nissl staining was performed to detect neuron numbers in hippocampal 
      tissues. Ultrastructure of hippocampal neurons was observed by transmission 
      electron microscopy. TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was 
      used to assess cell apoptosis, and Western blotting was applied to examine 
      expressions of apoptosis-related proteins. Compared to the NC group, the mice in 
      the T1DM group had increased expressions of TRPM7 and miR-34a; decreased weight 
      and fasting insulin; increased blood glucose and levels of ICA, IAA, and GAD-Ab; 
      prolonged escape latency; less time spent in the target quadrant; incomplete 
      neuronal structure; reduced neuron numbers; increased cell apoptosis and 
      expressions of activated Bax, Cyt-c, and cleaved caspase-3; but reduced Bcl-2 
      expression. In comparison to the T1DM group, the T1DM + si-TRPM7, 
      T1DM + si-miR-34a, and T1DM + si-TRPM7 + si-miR-34a groups showed increased 
      weight and fasting insulin; reduced blood glucose and levels of ICA, IAA, and 
      GAD-Ab; shortened escape latency; prolonged time spent in the target quadrant 
      platform; intact neuronal structure; increased neuron numbers; repaired neurons; 
      reduced cell apoptosis and expressions of activated Bax, Cyt-c, and cleaved 
      caspase-3; but increased Bcl-2 expression. The T1DM + si-TRPM7 + si-miR-34a group 
      underwent more obvious changes than the T1DM + si-TRPM7 and T1DM + si-miR-34a 
      groups. Our results demonstrated that TRPM7/miR-34a gene silencing could improve 
      spatial cognitive function and protect hippocampal neurogenesis in mice with 
      T1DM.

TI  - Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes Improve Functional Recovery in Rats After 
      Traumatic Brain Injury: A Dose-Response and Therapeutic Window Study.
PG  - 616-626
LID - 10.1177/1545968320926164 [doi]
AB  - Background. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes play a critical role in 
      regenerative medicine. Objective. To determine the dose- and time-dependent 
      efficacy of exosomes for treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods. Male 
      rats were subjected to a unilateral moderate cortical contusion. In the 
      dose-response study, animals received a single intravenous injection of exosomes 
      (50, 100, 200 µg per rat) or vehicle, with treatment initiated at 1 day after 
      injury. In the therapeutic window study, animals received a single intravenous 
      injection of 100 µg exosomes or vehicle starting at 1, 4, or 7 days after injury. 
      Neurological functional tests were performed weekly after TBI for 5 weeks. 
      Spatial learning was measured on days 31 to 35 after TBI using the Morris water 
      maze test. Results. Compared with the vehicle, regardless of the dose and delay 
      in treatment, exosome treatment significantly improved sensorimotor and cognitive 
      function, reduced hippocampal neuronal cell loss, promoted angiogenesis and 
      neurogenesis, and reduced neuroinflammation. Exosome treatment at 100 µg per rat 
      exhibited a significant therapeutic effect compared with the 50- or 200-µg 
      exosome groups. The time-dependent exosome treatment data demonstrated that 
      exosome treatment starting at 1 day post-TBI provided a significantly greater 
      improvement in functional and histological outcomes than exosome treatments at 
      the other 2 delayed treatments. Conclusions. These results indicate that exosomes 
      have a wide range of effective doses for treatment of TBI with a therapeutic 
      window of at least 7 days postinjury. Exosomes may provide a novel therapeutic 
      intervention in TBI.

AB  - In recent years, the number of patients with neurodegenerative illness such as 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) has increased with the aging of the population. In this 
      study, we evaluated the effect of Grape skin extract (GSE) on neurotypic SH-SY5Y 
      cells as an in vitro AD model, murine neurospheres as an ex vivo neurogenesis 
      model and SAMP8 mice as an in vivo AD model. Our in vitro result showed that 
      pre-treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with GSE ameliorated Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. 
      Moreover, GSE treatment significantly decreased the number of neurospheres, but 
      increased their size suggesting reduced stem cell self-renewal but increased 
      proliferation. Our in vivo Morris water maze test indicated that GSE improves 
      learning and memory in SAMP8 mice. To detect proliferation and newborn neurons, 
      we measured BrdU+ cells in the dentate gyrus (DG). GSE treatment increased the 
      number of BrdU+ cells in the DG of SAMP8 mice. Finally, we showed that GSE 
      induced a decrease in inflammatory cytokines and an increase in neurotransmitters 
      in the cerebral cortex of SAMP8 mice. These results suggested that GSE increased 
      neurogenic zone proliferation and memory but decreased oxidative stress 
      associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines in aging, thus protecting neurons.

      Gastrodia elata Bl. in the mass ratio of 4:1. This classic representative 
      traditional Chinese medicine has been widely used to treat brain diseases like 
      headache and migraine caused by blood stasis and wind pathogen. However, the 
      therapeutic effect of DCXF on traumatic brain injury (TBI) has not been reported 
      yet. AIM OF STUDY: The present study was performed to investigate the 
      neuroprotective effects of DCXF and its underlying mechanisms in the controlled 
      cortical impact (CCI)-induced TBI rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male 
      Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: Sham, TBI control, 1X DCXF 
      (520.6 mg/kg) and 5X DCXF (2603.0 mg/kg). Two treatment groups (1X and 5X DCXF) 
      were intragastrically administered daily for 7 days before CCI-induced TBI and 
      then DCXF treatments were continued post-TBI until the animal behavioral tests, 
      including Morris water maze test, acceleration rotarod motor test and CatWalk 
      quantitative gait analysis test, were done. The brain water content and blood 
      brain barrier (BBB) integrity were measured by wet-dry weight method and Evans 
      blue method, respectively. The number of neuron cells, neural stem cells (NSCs), 
      GFAP positive cells (astrocyte) as well as Iba-1 positive cells (microglia) were 
      determined by histology and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Treatment with DCXF 
      significantly improved the learning ability and memory retention in Morris water 
      maze test, and remarkably enhanced motor performances in acceleration rotarod 
      motor test and catwalk quantitative gait analysis test after TBI. Moreover, DCXF 
      treatment was able to reduce BBB permeability, brain edema, microglia and 
      astrocyte activation, improve the proliferation of NSCs and decrease neurons loss 
      in the brain with TBI. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that DCXF 
      treatment could decrease BBB leakage and brain edema, reduce neuron loss, 
      microglia and astrocyte activation, and increase NSCs proliferation, which may 
      contribute to the cognitive and motor protection of DCXF in the TBI rats. It is 
      the first time to provide potentially underlying mechanisms of the 
      neuroprotective effect of DCXF on TBI-induced brain damage and functional 
      outcomes.

AB  - Pilots and crew of domestic flights are exposed to transient periods of mild 
      reductions of partial pressure of inspired oxygen each day, and this might have 
      functional consequence on their performance in the long range. Here, we exposed 
      mice to mild reductions of oxygen exposure (ROE) four times per day for 21 days 
      by lowering oxygen partial pressure to levels corresponding to an altitude of 
      about 2300 m, which is the quote of pressurization of the air cabin. Four groups 
      of mice were studied: unstressed or stressed mice exposed to ROE or normoxic 
      conditions. Mice were exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) for 28 days, 
      and ROE was delivered in the last 21 days of CUS. In normoxic mice, CUS caused 
      anhedonia in the sucrose preference test, anxiety-like behaviour in the open 
      field test, learning impairment in the Morris water maze, reduced hippocampal 
      neurogenesis, increased serum corticosterone levels and increased expression of 
      depression-related genes (Pclo, Mthfr and Grm5) in the hippocampus. All these 
      changes were reversed by ROE, which had little or no effect in unstressed mice. 
      These findings suggest that ROE simulating air cabin conditions of domestic 
      flights may enhance resilience to stress improving mood, anxiety and learning 
      ability.

AB  - Although chemotherapy increases the survival rate of patients with various 
      cancers, such treatment can induce acute or long-term cognitive dysfunction a 
      phenomenon known as post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment (PCCI) or 
      "chemobrain." Exercise is known to positively affect brain function. Thus, the 
      present study aimed to determine whether symptoms of chemobrain and disruptions 
      in the neuroplasticity and functioning of hippocampal mitochondria can be 
      prevented or relieved by exercise. Wistar rats were separated into the following 
      groups: control, control plus exercise, chemobrain, and chemobrain plus exercise. 
      For chemobrain induction, 2 mg/kg of doxorubicin (DOX) a widely utilized 
      chemotherapeutic agent among patients with breast cancer was dissolved in saline 
      and directly injected to the abdomen once every 4 weeks. The exercise groups were 
      subjected to low-intensity treadmill, 6 days per week for 4 weeks. The Morris 
      water maze and step-down avoidance tests were conducted to evaluate cognitive 
      function, while neuroplasticity and mitochondrial function were assessed in the 
      hippocampus and dentate gyrus. Decreased cognitive function were observed in the 
      chemobrain group, along with decreases in levels of neurogenesis, brain derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), Ca(2+) retention 
      in hippocampus. Rats of the chemobrain group also exhibited an increase in 
      apoptosis, H(2)O(2) emission and permeability transition pore by hippocampal 
      mitochondria. However, exercise attenuated impairments in cognitive function, 
      neuroplasticity, and mitochondrial function induced by DOX treatment. Therefore, 
      the findings of the present study indicate that low-intensity exercise may assist 
      in preventing cognitive dysfunction during or after chemotherapy in patients with 
      various cancers, including breast cancer.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of Cerebrolysin's effects on long-term histological 
      outcomes and functional recovery in rats with moderate closed head injury.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors previously demonstrated that Cerebrolysin is effective for 
      treatment of mild closed head injury (CHI) when administered 4 hours after 
      injury. The aim of this study was to determine Cerebrolysin's effects on 
      functional and histological outcomes in rats subjected to moderate CHI. METHODS: 
      In this randomized, blinded, and vehicle-controlled preclinical trial, male adult 
      Wistar rats subjected to moderate CHI received either Cerebrolysin treatment at a 
      dose of 2.5 ml/kg (n = 13) or vehicle (saline, n = 13) intraperitoneally 
      administered daily for 10 days, starting at 4 hours after injury. Animals were 
      subjected to cognitive and sensorimotor functional tests at multiple time points, 
      and they were killed 3 months after injury. The brains were processed for 
      analyses of neuronal cell loss, amyloid precursor protein, axonal damage, and 
      neurogenesis. RESULTS: Compared with rats treated with vehicle (saline), rats 
      treated with Cerebrolysin had significantly increased numbers of neuroblasts and 
      newborn mature neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) and attenuated amyloid precursor 
      protein accumulation and axonal damage in various brain regions, as well as 
      decreased neuronal loss in the DG and cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) region of the 
      hippocampus (p < 0.05). Global testing using generalized estimating equations 
      showed a significant beneficial effect of Cerebrolysin treatment on sensorimotor 
      functional outcomes from 1 day to 3 months after injury compared to that of 
      saline treatment (p < 0.05). Compared with vehicle-treated rats, 
      Cerebrolysin-treated rats showed significantly and robustly improved long-term 
      (up to 3 months) cognitive functional recovery, as measured by social 
      interaction, Morris water maze, novel object recognition, and odor recognition 
      tests. In the Cerebrolysin-treated rats there were significant correlations 
      between multiple histological outcomes and functional recovery evident 3 months 
      after moderate CHI, as indicated by Pearson partial correlation analyses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings demonstrate that Cerebrolysin treatment 
      significantly improves long-term functional and histological outcomes in rats 
      with moderate CHI, with functional outcomes significantly correlated with 
      histological indices of neuroplasticity and neuroprotection. These data indicate 
      that Cerebrolysin may be useful for the treatment of moderate CHI.

TI  - Binge Alcohol Exposure Causes Neurobehavioral Deficits and GSK3β Activation in 
      the Hippocampus of Adolescent Rats.

AB  - Heavy alcohol exposure causes profound damage to the adolescent brain, 
      particularly the hippocampus, which underlie some behavioral deficits. However, 
      the underlying molecular mechanisms remain inconclusive. The current study sought 
      to determine whether binge alcohol exposure affects the hippocampus-related 
      behaviors and key signaling proteins that may mediate alcohol neurotoxicity in 
      adolescent rats. Alcohol exposure reduced the number of both NeuN-positive and 
      doublecortin-positive cells in the hippocampus. Alcohol also induced 
      neurodegeneration which was confirmed by ultrastructural analysis by electronic 
      microscopy and was accompanied with the activation of microglia. Binge alcohol 
      exposure impaired spatial learning and memory which was evaluated by the Morris 
      water maze. However, alcohol did not alter the spontaneous locomotor activity 
      which was determined by the open field test. GSK3β is a multi-function 
      serine/threonine protein kinase regulating both neuronal survival and 
      neurogenesis and plays an important role in various neurodegenerative disorders. 
      We have previously shown that GSK3β is a key mediator of alcohol-induced neuron 
      apoptosis in the developing brain. We showed here binge alcohol exposure caused 
      GSK3β activation by inducing dephosphorylation at Ser9 without affecting the 
      phosphorylation of Tyr216 in the hippocampus. Thus, GSK3β may be involved in 
      binge alcohol exposure-induced neuronal damage to the adolescent hippocampus.

AB  - Physical exercise improves learning and memory abilities by increasing the levels 
      of several growth factors in the hippocampus. One growth factor, vascular 
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is primarily produced in the muscles and not 
      only increases in the periphery during exercise but can also cross the 
      blood-brain barrier. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of 
      regular aerobic chronic exercise on different types of muscle fibers and the 
      relationships between learning/memory and muscle induced-VEGF. Following a 
      one-week adaptation period, male rats underwent treadmill training at a speed of 
      8 m/min for 30 min daily, 3 days a week for 6 weeks. Memory functions were 
      evaluated using the Morris water maze. VEGF, superoxide dismutase (SOD), 
      glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured in 
      type 1 and type 2 muscle fibers and VEGF levels were also measured in the 
      hippocampus. Exercise positively affected both learning and memory and also 
      increased VEGF levels in both muscle fiber types. Muscle VEGF levels positively 
      correlate with hippocampal learning and hippocampal VEGF levels. Exercise reduced 
      both SOD and MDA levels in type 1 and type 2 muscle fibers, whereas GPx levels 
      decreased only in type 2 muscle fibers. Our findings suggest that regular aerobic 
      exercise elevates VEGF levels and diminishes oxidative stress in both fiber 
      types. Exercise-induced VEGF levels in both type 1 and 2 muscle fibers appear to 
      be associated with the positive effect of exercise on learning and memory 
      function and is accompanied by an increase in VEGF levels in the hippocampus. 
      Further research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanism by which fiber

TI  - Chronic α-Synuclein Accumulation in Rat Hippocampus Induces Lewy Bodies Formation 
      and Specific Cognitive Impairments.

AB  - Occurrence of Lewy bodies (LBs)/Lewy neurites (LNs) containing misfolded 
      fibrillar α-synuclein (α-syn) is one of the pathologic hallmarks of memory 
      impairment-linked synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and 
      dementia with LBs (DLB). While it has been shown that brainstem LBs may 
      contribute to motor symptoms, the neuropathological substrates for cognitive 
      symptoms are still elusive. Here, recombinant mouse α-syn fibrils were 
      bilaterally injected in the hippocampus of female Sprague Dawley rats, which 
      underwent behavioral testing for sensorimotor and spatial learning and memory 
      abilities. No sensorimotor deficits affecting Morris water maze task performance 
      were observed, nor was any reference memory disturbances detectable in injected 
      animals. By contrast, significant impairments in working memory performance 
      became evident at 12 months postinjection. These deficits were associated to a 
      time-dependent increase in the levels of phosphorylated α-syn at Ser129 and in 
      the stereologically estimated numbers of proteinase K (PK)-resistant α-syn 
      aggregates within the hippocampus. Interestingly, pathologic α-syn aggregates 
      were found in the entorhinal cortex and, by 12 months postinjection, also in the 
      vertical limb of the diagonal band and the piriform cortices. No pathologic α-syn 
      deposits were found within the substantia nigra (SN), the ventral tegmental area 
      (VTA), or the striatum, nor was any loss of dopaminergic, noradrenergic, or 
      cholinergic neurons detected in α-syn-injected animals, compared with controls. 
      This would suggest that the behavioral impairments seen in the α-syn-injected 
      animals might be determined by the long-term α-syn neuropathology, rather than by 
      neurodegeneration per se, thus leading to the onset of working memory deficits.

AB  - Hearing loss and cognitive decline are commonly associated with aging and 
      morbidity. Present clinical interest lies in whether peripheral hearing loss 
      promotes cognitive decline and if prophylaxis with selective adenosine receptor 
      agonist CGS21680 effectively mitigates the adverse effects. In the current study, 
      male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 200-250 g m were randomly allocated into three 
      groups: Group 1) rats exposed to 100 dB SPL white noise, 2 h a day for 15 
      consecutive days, 2) rats supplemented with an adenosine receptor agonist, 
      CGS21680 at 100 μg/kg/day prior to noise exposure and 3) unexposed control rats. 
      Baseline hearing and cognition assessed by auditory brainstem response (ABR) and 
      water maze respectively was undertaken for all the groups. Phalloidin stain and 
      synaptic ribbons count in cochlea, and, Ki67, DCX and NeuN in hippocampus were 
      observed by immunohistochemistry. It was inferred that noise exposed rats showed 
      elevated thresholds of ABR and poorer performances in spatial working memory when 
      compared with controls. On the contrary, CGS21680 administered group exhibited 
      improved ABR and cognitive functions with shorter mean latency and path-length to 
      reach the platform, significant reduction in the noise induced loss of synaptic 
      ribbons count and increased number of Ki67 and doublecortin (DCX) positive cells 
      compared to their noise exposed counterparts. Pharmacologic intervention with 
      selective A(2A) receptor agonist CGS21680 provided adequate protection from noise 
      by effectively maintaining hearing threshold levels, cell viability in cochlea 
      and hippocampus & functional/intact reference memory.

TI  - Deep Brain Stimulation Rescues Memory and Synaptic Activity in a Rat Model of 
      Global Ischemia.
PG  - 2430-2440

AB  - Ischemic stroke is responsible for a large number of neurological deficits 
      including memory impairment. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), a well established 
      therapeutic modality for the treatment of movement disorders, has recently shown 
      potential beneficial effects on memory in animals and patients with Alzheimer's 
      disease. Here, we test DBS for its ability to improve memory impairments by 
      stimulating the entorhinal cortex (EC) in a rat model of global ischemia (GI). 
      Two weeks after GI, adult male rats received high-frequency EC DBS for 1 h, and 
      animals were assessed for changes in locomotor activity, learning, and memory 6 
      weeks later. GI produced spatial memory impairment that was ameliorated by DBS, 
      with no difference between the group that received DBS for GI (GI-DBS ON group) 
      and nonstroke control groups. Although GI led to a dramatic CA1 neuronal loss 
      that could not be rescued with DBS, stimulation attenuated the reduction of CA1 
      synaptophysin expression after GI. Further, in vitro slice recordings showed a 
      restoration of typical evoked synaptic dendritic fields in GI-DBS ON animals, 
      indicating that the DBS-induced memory rescue is associated with increased 
      synaptophysin expression and enhanced synaptic function. These results suggest 
      that DBS may ameliorate the functional consequences of cerebral ischemia and 
      point to be a potential new therapeutic approach.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Deep 
      brain stimulation (DBS) is remarkably effective in treating Parkinson's disease 
      and is currently under investigation for the treatment of neuropsychiatric 
      disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Until now, DBS has not been examined for 
      its cognitive benefits in the context of hypoxic-ischemic injuries. Here, we 
      investigated the effect of DBS in a rat model of global ischemia (GI) that mimics 
      the neurological consequences occurring after a cardiac arrest. We show that DBS 
      rescues memory deficits induced by GI and produces changes in synaptic activity 
      in the hippocampus. Novel approaches to improve neurological outcomes after 
      stroke are urgently needed; therefore, the present study highlights a possible 
      role for DBS in the treatment of cognitive impairment associated with ischemia.

TI  - A Role for Nrf2 Expression in Defining the Aging of Hippocampal Neural Stem 
      Cells.
PG  - 589-606

AB  - Redox mechanisms are emerging as essential to stem cell function given their 
      capacity to influence a number of important signaling pathways governing stem 
      cell survival and regenerative activity. In this context, our recent work 
      identified the reduced expression of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, 
      or Nrf2, in mediating the decline in subventricular zone neural stem progenitor 
      cell (NSPC) regeneration during aging. Since Nrf2 is a major transcription factor 
      at the heart of cellular redox regulation and homeostasis, the current study 
      investigates the role that it may play in the aging of NSPCs that reside within 
      the other major mammalian germinal niche located in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of 
      the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Using rats from multiple aging stages 
      ranging from newborn to old age, and aging Nrf2 knockout mice, we first 
      determined that, in contrast with subventricular zone (SVZ) NSPCs, Nrf2 
      expression does not significantly affect overall DG NSPC viability with age. 
      However, DG NSPCs resembled SVZ stem cells, in that Nrf2 expression controlled 
      their proliferation and the balance of neuronal versus glial differentiation 
      particularly in relation to a specific critical period during middle age. Also, 
      importantly, this Nrf2-based control of NSPC regeneration was found to impact 
      functional neurogenesis-related hippocampal behaviors, particularly in the Morris 
      water maze and in pattern separation tasks. Furthermore, the enrichment of the 
      hippocampal environment via the transplantation of Nrf2-overexpressing NSPCs was 
      able to mitigate the age-related decline in DG stem cell regeneration during the 
      critical middle-age period, and significantly improved pattern separation 
      abilities. In summary, these results emphasize the importance of Nrf2 in DG NSPC 
      regeneration, and support Nrf2 upregulation as a potential approach to 
      advantageously modulate DG NSPC activity with age.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative 
      diseases in the older population and characterized by progressive memory and 
      cognitive impairment. Cyperus rotundus, a traditional medicinal herb, has 
      analgesic, sedative, and anti-inflammatory effects and also used to increase 
      memory in Islamic traditional medicine. This study was designed to consider the 
      effects of C. rotundus extract on memory impairment and neurogenesis in the 
      Beta-Amyloid rats' model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two male Wistar rats were 
      randomly divided into six groups (n = 7) for the evaluation of baseline training 
      performance in the Morris water maze test. Then, amyloid-beta (Aβ1-42) was 
      injected in animal hippocampal CA1 bilaterally in four groups. The first probe 
      trial was performed 21 days after Aβ injection. Then, 250, 500, and 750 mg/kg of 
      C. rotundus extract were administered to three Aβ-injected groups for 1 month; 
      after that, the second probe trial was performed, and rats were sacrificed after 
      28 days of the second probe trial. The neurogenesis was detected in the 
      hippocampus, by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: This study showed that 
      spatial memory increased in the behavioral test in AD treated group with C. 
      rotundus extract, compared with the AD group (P = 0.02). Immunohistochemical 
      staining revealed that neuronal differentiation has been occurred in the 
      hippocampus in the AD-treated group with C. rotundus extract compared with the AD 
      group (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that C. rotundus extract, 
      repaired spatial memory impairment in the Aβ rats, through increased neurogenesis 
      in the hippocampus, which could be related to the flavonoid components in the 
      extract.

LID - 10.1007/s12640-020-00250-9 [doi]
AB  - The present study investigated the effects of forced overexpression of Phox2a/2b, 
      two transcription factors, in the locus coeruleus (LC) of aged rats on 
      noradrenergic and dopaminergic phenotypes in brains. Results showed that a 
      significant increase in Phox2a/2b mRNA levels in the LC region was paralleled by 
      marked enhancement in expression of DBH and TH per se. Furthermore, similar 
      increases in TH protein levels were observed in the substantial nigra and 
      striatum, as well as in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Overexpression of 
      Phox2 genes also significantly increased BrdU-positive cells in the hippocampal 
      dentate gyrus and NE levels in the striatum. Moreover, this manipulation 
      significantly improved the cognition behavior. The in vitro experiments revealed 
      that norepinephrine treatments may increase the transcription of TH gene through 
      the epigenetic action on the TH promoter. The results indicate that Phox2 genes 
      may play an important role in improving the function of the noradrenergic and 
      dopaminergic neurons in aged animals, and regulation of Phox2 gene expression may 
      have therapeutic utility in aging or disorders involving degeneration of 
      noradrenergic neurons.

AB  - Isorhamnetin (IRN), a 3'-O-methylated metabolite of quercetin has antioxidant, 
      anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. In this study, we investigated 
      the learning and memory enhancing effects of IRN on spatial and non-spatial 
      learning and memory deficits induced by scopolamine (3 mg/kg, i.p; muscarinic 
      antagonist) using the novel object recognition test (NORT) and Morris water maze 
      (MWM) task. IRN (1, 5 or 50 mg/kg, p.o.) or vehicle was administered to male 
      albino for 3 consecutive days, scopolamine was given 1 h after last 
      administration on day 3. Five minutes post scopolamine administration the 
      behavioural test of cognitive function was carried out. One hour after probe test 
      (MWM task) on day 7, the brains were isolated to assay for oxidative stress, 
      cholinesterase activity and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in 
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIPPO). IRN treatment significantly 
      improved scopolamine-induced learning and memory impairment in behavioural tests. 
      IRN reduced malondialdehyde and nitrite generation induced by scopolamine through 
      increase in glutathione (GSH) level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase 
      (CAT) activities in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. In addition, IRN 
      attenuates scopolamine induced cholinesterase activity and BDNF level in the 
      prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of mice. Findings from this study showed that 
      IRN possesses cognition and memory enhancing properties possibly through 
      enhancement of antioxidant defense system, cholinergic signaling and synaptic 
      plasticity.

AB  - While increasing evidence demonstrated that voluntary wheel running promotes 
      cognitive function, little is known on how different types of voluntary wheel 
      running affect cognitive function in elderly populations. We investigated the 
      effects of various voluntary wheel-running types on adult hippocampal 
      neurogenesis and spatial cognition in middle-aged mice. Male C57BL6 and 
      Thy1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice (13 months) were equally 
      assigned to one of the following groups: (1) T1: no voluntary wheel running; (2) 
      T2: intermittent voluntary wheel running; and (3) T3: continuous voluntary wheel 
      running. The Thy1-GFP transgenic mice were used to specifically label granule 
      cells, since Thy-1 is a promoter for neuronal expression. Behavioral evaluations 
      suggested that intermittent voluntary wheel running improved Morris water maze 
      performance in middle-aged mice. The number of BrdU-positive cells was 
      significantly higher in both intermittent and continuous voluntary wheel running 
      compared with no voluntary wheel running. However, only intermittent voluntary 
      wheel running facilitated the newborn cells to differentiate into granule cells, 
      while newborn cells tended to differentiate into astrocytes and repopulation of 
      microglia was also enhanced in the continuous voluntary wheel-running group. 
      These results indicated that intermittent voluntary exercise may be more 
      beneficial for enhancing spatial memory. Effective improvement of hippocampal 
      neurogenesis was also caused by intermittent voluntary wheel running in 
      middle-aged mice.

TI  - Smo-Shh signaling activator purmorphamine ameliorates neurobehavioral, molecular, 
      and morphological alterations in an intracerebroventricular propionic 
      acid-induced experimental model of autism.
PG  - 1880-1898

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disease 
      characterized by cognitive and sensorimotor impairment. Numerous research 
      findings have consistently shown that alteration of Smo-Shh (smoothened-sonic 
      hedgehog) signaling during the developmental process plays a significant role in 
      ASD and triggers neuronal changes by promoting neuroinflammation and apoptotic 
      markers. Purmorphamine (PUR), a small purine-derived agonist of the Smo-Shh 
      pathway, shows resistance to hippocampal neuronal cell oxidation and decreases 
      neuronal cell death. The goal of this study was to investigate the 
      neuroprotective potential of PUR in brain intoxication induced by 
      intracerebroventricular-propionic acid (ICV-PPA) in rats, with a focus on its 
      effect on Smo-Shh regulation in the brain of rats. In addition, we analyze the 
      impact of PUR on myelin basic protein (MBP) and apoptotic markers such as 
      Caspase-3, Bax (pro-apoptotic), and Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic) in rat brain 
      homogenates. Chronic ICV-PPA infusion was administered consecutively for 11 days 
      to induce autism in rats. In order to investigate behavioral alterations, rats 
      were tested for spatial learning in the Morris Water Maze (MWM), locomotive 
      alterations using actophotometer, and beam crossing task, while Forced Swimming 
      Test (FST) for depressive behavior. PUR treatment with 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg 
      (i.p.) was administered from day 12 to 44. Besides cellular, molecular and 
      neuroinflammatory analyses, neurotransmitter levels and oxidative markers have 
      also been studied in brain homogenates. The results of this study have shown that 
      PUR increases the level of Smo-Shh and restores the neurochemical levels, and 
      potentially prevents morphological changes, including demyelination.

TI  - Remote memory of drug experiences coexists with cognitive decline and abnormal 
      adult neurogenesis in an animal model of cocaine-altered cognition.
PG  - e12886
LID - 10.1111/adb.12886 [doi]
AB  - Cocaine addiction is a chronic disorder in which the person loses control over 
      drug use. The past memories of the stimuli associated with the drug are a 
      relevant clinical problem, since they trigger compulsive drug-seeking and 
      drug-taking habits. Furthermore, these persistent drug-related memories seemingly 
      coexist with cognitive decline that predicts worse therapeutic output. Here, we 
      use a new animal model of cocaine-altered cognition that allowed to observe these 
      events in the same individual and study their relationship. Mice were chronically 
      administered cocaine in a conditioned place preference (CPP) apparatus for 14 
      days, and control mice received saline. After 28 days of cocaine withdrawal, 
      animals were tested for retrieval of remote drug-associated memory as well as for 
      cognitive performance in a battery of tests, including novel object and place 
      recognition and spatial memory. The cocaine-withdrawn mice showed persistent CPP 
      memory while impaired in the cognitive tasks, displaying deficits in reference 
      memory acquisition and working memory. However, the CPP expression was not 
      associated with the defective cognitive performance, indicating that they were 
      concomitant but independent occurrences. After completion of the experiment, 
      adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) was studied as a relevant neurobiological 
      correlate due to its potential role in both learning and drug addiction. Results 
      suggested a preserved basal AHN in the cocaine-withdrawn mice but an aberrant 
      learning-induced regulation of these neurons. This paradigm may be useful to 
      investigate maladaptive cognition in drug addiction as well as related therapies.

AB  - Maternal melatonin provides photoperiodic information to the fetus and thus 
      influences the regulation and timing of the offspring's internal rhythms and 
      preparation for extra-uterine development. There is clinical evidence that 
      melatonin deprivation of both mother and fetus during pregnancy, and of the 
      neonate during lactation, results in negative long-term health outcomes. As a 
      consequence, we hypothesized that the absence of maternal pineal melatonin might 
      determine abnormal brain programming in the offspring, which would lead to 
      long-lasting implications for behavior and brain function. To test our 
      hypothesis, we investigated in rats the effects of maternal melatonin deprivation 
      during gestation and lactation (MMD) to the offspring and the effects of its 
      therapeutic replacement. The parameters evaluated were: (1) somatic, physical 
      growth and neurobehavioral development of pups of both sexes; (2) 
      hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory of the male offspring; (3) 
      adult hippocampal neurogenesis of the male offspring. Our findings show that MMD 
      significantly delayed male offspring's onset of fur development, pinna 
      detachment, eyes opening, eruption of superior incisor teeth, testis descent and 
      the time of maturation of palmar grasp, righting reflex, free-fall righting and 
      walking. Conversely, female offspring neurodevelopment was not affected. Later 
      on, male offspring show that MMD was able to disrupt both spatial reference and 
      working memory in the Morris Water Maze paradigm and these deficits correlate 
      with changes in the number of proliferative cells in the hippocampus. 
      Importantly, all the observed impairments were reversed by maternal melatonin

TI  - Persistent Lin28 Expression Impairs Neurite Outgrowth and Cognitive Function in 
      the Developing Mouse Neocortex.
PG  - 3780-3795
LID - 10.1007/s12035-018-1297-0 [doi]
AB  - Many neurodevelopmental disorders feature learning and memory difficulties. 
      Regulation of neurite outgrowth during development is critical for neural 
      plasticity and memory function. Here, we show a novel regulator of neurite 
      outgrowth during cortical neurogenesis, Lin28, which is an RNA-binding protein. 
      Persistent Lin28 upregulation by in utero electroporation at E14.5 resulted in 
      neurite underdevelopment during cortical neurogenesis. We also showed that 
      Lin28-overexpressing cells had an attenuated response to excitatory inputs and 
      altered membrane properties including higher input resistance, slower action 
      potential repolarization, and smaller hyperpolarization-activated cation 
      currents, supporting impaired neuronal functionality in Lin28-electroporated 
      mice. When we ameliorated perturbed Lin28 expression by siRNA, Lin28-induced 
      neurite underdevelopment was rescued with reduction of Lin28-downstream 
      molecules, high mobility group AT-Hook 2, and insulin-like growth factor 1 
      receptor. Finally, Lin28-electroporated mice showed significant memory deficits 
      as assessed by the Morris water maze test. Taken together, these findings 
      demonstrate a new role and the essential requirement of Lin28 in developmental 
      control of neurite outgrowth, which has an impact on synaptic plasticity and 
      spatial memory. These findings suggest that targeting Lin28 may attenuate 
      intellectual disabilities by correction of impaired dendritic complexity, 
      providing a novel therapeutic candidate for treating neurodevelopmental 
      disorders.

TI  - Maternal Swimming Exercise During Pregnancy Improves Memory Through Enhancing 
      Neurogenesis and Suppressing Apoptosis via Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway in Autistic 
      Mice.
PG  - S63-71
LID - 10.5213/inj.2142338.169 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Wnt pathway is closely related to neurodevelopmental process associated 
      with cognitive function. After administration of valproic acid to the pregnant 
      mice, the effect of swimming exercise of pregnant mice on the memory, neuronal 
      production, and apoptosis of pups was studied in relation with Wnt/β-catenin 
      signaling pathway. METHODS: On day 12 of pregnancy, mice were injected 
      subcutaneously with 400-mg/kg valproic acid. The pregnant mice in the control 
      with swimming exercise group and in the valproic acid injection with swimming 
      exercise group were allowed for swimming for 30 minutes one time per a day, 
      repeated 5 days per a week, during 3 weeks. Step-through avoidance task and 
      Morris water maze task for memory function, immunohistochemistry for 
      5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells and western blot for brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Wnt, β-catenin, Bcl-2 related X protein (Bax), B-cell 
      lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), cleaved caspase-3 were carried out. RESULTS: Maternal 
      swimming exercise during pregnancy improved memory function, increased BDNF 
      expression, and neuronal proliferation in the valproic acid injected pups. 
      Maternal swimming exercise during pregnancy suppressed Wnt expression and 
      phosphorylation of β-catenin in the valproic acid injected pups. Maternal 
      swimming exercise inhibited Bax and cleaved caspase-3 expression and increased 
      Bcl-2 expression in the valproic acid injected pups. CONCLUSION: Maternal 
      swimming exercise during pregnancy improved memory function by increasing cell 
      proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis through Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade 
      activation in the valproic acid injected pups. Maternal swimming exercise during 
      pregnancy may have a protective effect on factors that induce autism in the 
      fetus.

TI  - Involvement of Paired Immunoglobulin-like Receptor B in Diabetes-Associated 
      Cognitive Dysfunction Through Modulation of Axon Outgrowth and Dendritic 
      Remodeling.
PG  - 2563-2579
LID - 10.1007/s12035-021-02679-1 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetic patients have high risk of developing cognitive dysfunction, in 
      which neural structural plasticity has played a pivotal role. Paired 
      immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB), a receptor mainly expressed in neurons, 
      acts as a critical inhibitor of neurite outgrowth and neural plasticity. However, 
      the role of PirB in type 2 diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction remains 
      unknown. In this study, learning and memory impairment was observed in 
      24-week-old db/db mice by performing Morris water maze task, and the number of 
      synapses along with the length of postsynaptic density by transmission electron 
      microscopy were reduced in the hippocampus of db/db mice. Furthermore, PirB 
      expression in the hippocampus of db/db mice was significantly upregulated using 
      western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. In cultured hippocampal 
      neurons, high glucose treatment reduced the length of the longest neurite as well 
      as axon initial segment (AIS), whereas silencing PirB expression rescued high 
      glucose-induced neurite outgrowth inhibition, but not AIS. Additionally, 
      cognitive deficits, dendrite morphology defects, and synapse-related proteins 
      loss in db/db mice were alleviated when PirB knockdown was performed by 
      adeno-associated virus injection. In conclusion, PirB is involved in 
      diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction through modulation of axon outgrowth 
      and dendritic remodeling, providing a potential therapeutic target for 
      diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Saikosaponin-d (SSd), one of the main constituents of the total saikosaponins 
      extracted from Bupleurum falcatum L, possesses anti-inflammatory and 
      anti-apoptosis effect. Recently, SSd was proved to improve depressive symptoms 
      although exhibit hepatotoxicity in animals, but the central nervous system (CNS) 
      toxicity of SSd remains unclear. The present study investigated the SSd-induced 
      impairment in hippocampal cognitive function and explored the possible mechanisms 
      involved. After intragastric administration of SSd (4mg/kg, 8mg/kg) for 7days, 
      the learning and memory abilities of mice were evaluated by behavioral 
      experiments. In the step-down passive avoidance test, we found that the mice 
      treated with SSd showed a significant decrease of step-down latency and increase 
      of the frequency of errors. In the Morris water maze task, both the escape 
      latency and swimming distance of the mice treated with SSd were increased, 
      correspondingly, both the time of mice staying in the target zone and the 
      frequency of crossing platform were decreased. These neurobehavioral changes were 
      accompanied by the reduction of the expression of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), 
      nestin, doublecortin (Dcx) and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2). Moreover, 
      SSd significantly inhibited the expression of p-Akt, Foxg-1 and fibroblast growth 
      factor 2 (FGF2) in the hippocampus of mice. These results indicated that SSd had 
      a toxic effect on cognitive function in mice, which was associated with 
      inhibiting the hippocampal neurogenesis via Akt/Foxg1 pathway.

AB  - The current study was designed to investigate the protective effects of Vitamin D 
      (VD) on hippocampal neurogenesis, apoptosis, and subsequent hippocampal-dependent 
      learning and memory performance in hypothyroid juvenile rats. Twenty eight male 
      Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups as; control, Hypothyroid 
      (Hypo), Hypo-VD100 and Hypo-VD500. Hypothyroidism was induced by giving 0.05 % 
      propylthiouracil (PTU), and VD (100 or 500 IU/kg) treatment was performed daily 
      by gavage. At the end of treatment, Morris water maze (MWM) was carried out and 
      evaluated hippocampal neurogenesis, apoptosis, and dark neurons (DNs). Our 
      results revealed that the escape latency and the traveled distance to find the 
      platform in the Hypo group were significantly longer but the time spent and 
      distance traveled in the target area in probe trial was lower than the control 
      group. Hypothyroidism was accompanied by a marked decrease in hippocampal 
      neurogenesis, and a significant increase in the number of apoptotic neurons and 
      DNs compared to the control group. VD decreased escape latency and the traveled 
      distance to find the platform but increased the time spent and distance traveled 
      in the target area in probe trial than the Hypo group. VD also increased 
      neurogenesis, reduced apoptosis and DNs production compared to the Hypo group. In 
      conclusion, these results support a role for VD in the restoring hippocampal 
      neurogenesis impairment, reducing neuronal apoptosis, and DNs in hypothyroid rats 
      as well as raise the possibility that VD may contribute as a therapeutic approach 
      to improve the learning and memory deficits associated with hypothyroidism.

      detect cognitive impairment at an early stage in an App knock-in mouse model of 
      Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by cognitive decline with accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and 
      neurofibrillary tangles that usually begins 15-30 years before clinical 
      diagnosis. Rodent models that recapitulate aggressive Aβ and/or the pathology of 
      neurofibrillary tangles are essential for AD research. Accordingly, non-invasive 
      early detection systems in these animal models are required to evaluate the 
      phenotypic changes, elucidate the mechanism of disease progression, and 
      facilitate development of novel therapeutic approaches. Although many behavioral 
      tests efficiently reveal cognitive impairments at the later stage of the disease 
      in AD models, it has been challenging to detect such impairments at the early 
      stage. To address this issue, we subjected 4-6-month-old male App(NL-G-F/NL-G-F) 
      knock-in (App-KI) mice to touchscreen-based location discrimination (LD), 
      different object-location paired-associate learning (dPAL), and reversal learning 
      tests, and compared the results with those of the classical Morris water maze 
      test. These tests are mainly dependent on the brain regions prone to Aβ 
      accumulation at the earliest stages of the disease. At 4-6 months, considered to 
      represent the early stage of disease when mice exhibit initial deposition of Aβ 
      and slight gliosis, the classical Morris water maze test revealed no difference 
      between groups, whereas touchscreen-based LD and dPAL tasks revealed significant 
      impairments in task performance. Our report is the first to confirm that a 
      systematic touchscreen-based behavioral test battery can sensitively detect the 
      early stage of cognitive decline in an AD-linked App-KI mouse model. This system 
      could be applied in future translational research.

TI  - Effectiveness of low dose of rapamycin in preventing seizure-induced anxiety-like 
      behaviour, cognitive impairment, and defects in neurogenesis in developing rats.
PG  - 9-18
LID - 10.1080/00207454.2018.1486827 [doi]
AB  - Aims: Previous studies have demonstrated that rapamycin prevents seizure-induced 
      anxiety-like behaviors. However, rapamycin had been used at a higher dose of 3 
      mg/kg and resulted in side effects in immature animals. This work was designed to 
      explore whether a lower dose of rapamycin has similar efficacy but has milder 
      side effects.Methods: Acute seizures were induced by injection of pilocarpine at 
      postnatal 10-day Sprague-Dawley rats. Western blot analysis was used to detect 
      changes in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway after seizure. 
      Immunofluorescent intensity of doublecortin (DCX) was conducted to evaluate the 
      development of neurons in hippocampus. Morris water maze and Y-maze test were 
      used to assess cognitive functions and open-field test and elevated plus maze 
      were used to detect anxiety-like behaviors 4 weeks after seizure onset.Results: 
      mTOR pathway was abnormally activated with two peaks after pilocarpine-induced 
      seizures, and no difference of DCX-positive cells and body weight were noticed 
      between control and pilocarpine-induced seizure rats. Pilocarpine-induced seizure 
      in postnatal 10 days rats did not exert impairment on cognitive functions, but 
      resulted in obvious anxiety-like behaviors. Low dose of rapamycin at 0.3 mg/kg 
      significantly reversed seizure-induced increase of p-S6 levels as well as 
      abnormal anxiety-like behaviors. In addition, rapamycin at the dose of 0.3mg/kg 
      did not affect normal development and cognitive functions.Conclusion: lower doses 
      of rapamycin should be used in infants compared with older children or adults.

LID - dev168120 [pii]

AB  - The self-renewal activity of neural stem cells (NSCs) has been suggested to 
      decrease with aging, resulting in age-dependent declines in brain function, such 
      as presbyopia and memory loss. The molecular mechanisms underlying decreases in 
      NSC proliferation with age need to be elucidated in more detail to develop 
      treatments that promote brain function. We have previously reported that the 
      expression of esophageal cancer-related gene 4 (Ecrg4) was upregulated in aged 
      NSCs, whereas its overexpression decreased NSC proliferation, suggesting a 
      functional relationship between Ecrg4 and NSC aging. Using Ecrg4-deficient mice 
      in which the Ecrg4 locus was replaced with the lacZ gene, we here show that Ecrg4 
      deficiency recovered the age-dependent decline in NSC proliferation and enhanced 
      spatial learning and memory in the Morris water-maze paradigm. We demonstrate 
      that the proliferation of Ecrg4-deficient NSCs was partly maintained by the 
      increased expression of Foxg1. Collectively, these results determine Ecrg4 as a 
      NSC aging factor.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder strongly 
      correlated with a dysfunctional immune system. Our previous results demonstrated 
      that inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) facilitates hippocampal neurogenesis and 
      blocks lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cognitive impairment. However, whether 
      IIV improves cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model remains unclear. In 
      addition, early interventions in AD have been encouraged in recent years. Here, 
      we investigated whether IIV immunization at the preclinical stage of AD alters 
      the brain pathology and cognitive deficits in an APP/ PS1 mouse model. METHODS: 
      We assessed spatial learning and memory using Morris water maze (MWM). The brain 
      β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque burden and activated microglia were investigated by 
      immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the 
      proportions of Treg cells in the spleen. A cytokine antibody array was performed 
      to measure the alteration of cytokines in the brain and peripheral immune system. 
      RESULTS: Five IIV immunizations activated microglia, reduced the Aβ burden and 
      improved the cognitive impairment. Simultaneously, the IIV-induced immune 
      response broke peripheral immunosuppression by reducing Foxp3(+) regulatory T 
      cell (Treg) activities, whereas the restoration of Treg level in the periphery 
      using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) blunted the protective effects of IIV on Aβ 
      burden and cognitive functions. Interestingly, IIV immunization might increase 
      proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in the brain of APP/PS1 
      mice, enhanced microglial activation, and enhanced the clustering and 
      phagocytosis of Aβ, thereby creating new homeostasis in the disordered immune 
      microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our results suggest that early 
      multiple IIV immunizations exert a beneficial immunomodulatory effect in APP/PS1 
      mice by breaking Treg-mediated systemic immune tolerance, maintaining the 
      activation of microglia and removing of Aβ plaques, eventually improving 
      cognitive deficits.

TI  - Paradoxical effects of exercise on hippocampal plasticity and cognition in mice 
      with a heterozygous null mutation in the serotonin transporter gene.
PG  - 3279-3296
LID - 10.1111/bph.14760 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Exercise is known to improve cognitive function, but the 
      exact synaptic and cellular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the 
      potential role of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) in mediating these 
      effects. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and 
      neurogenesis were measured in standard-housed and exercising (wheel running) 
      wild-type (WT) and SERT heterozygous (HET) mice. We also assessed 
      hippocampal-dependent cognition using the Morris water maze (MWM) and a spatial 
      pattern separation touchscreen task. KEY RESULTS: SERT HET mice had impaired 
      hippocampal LTP regardless of the housing conditions. Exercise increased 
      hippocampal neurogenesis in WT mice. However, this was not observed in SERT HET 
      animals, even though both genotypes used the running wheels to a similar extent. 
      We also found that standard-housed SERT HET mice displayed altered cognitive 
      flexibility than WT littermate controls in the MWM reversal learning task. 
      However, SERT HET mice no longer exhibited this phenotype after exercise. 
      Cognitive changes, specific to SERT HET mice in the exercise condition, were also 
      revealed on the touchscreen spatial pattern separation task, especially when the 
      cognitive pattern separation load was at its highest. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: Our study is the first evidence of reduced hippocampal LTP in SERT 
      HET mice. We also show that functional SERT is required for exercise-induced 
      increase in adult neurogenesis. Paradoxically, exercise had a negative impact on 
      hippocampal-dependent cognitive tasks, especially in SERT HET mice. Taken 
      together, our results suggest unique complex interactions between exercise and 
      altered 5-HT homeostasis.

TI  - The Effects of Gene-Environment Interactions Between Cadmium Exposure and 
      Apolipoprotein E4 on Memory in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 189-201
LID - 10.1093/toxsci/kfz218 [doi]
AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal of great public health concern. Recent studies 
      suggested a link between Cd exposure and cognitive decline in humans. The ε4 
      allele, compared with the common ε3 allele, of the human apolipoprotein E gene 
      (ApoE) is associated with accelerated cognitive decline and increased risks for 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate the gene-environment interactions (GxE) 
      between ApoE-ε4 and Cd exposure on cognition, we used a mouse model of AD that 
      expresses human ApoE-ε3 (ApoE3-KI [knock-in]) or ApoE-ε4 (ApoE4-KI). Mice were 
      exposed to 0.6 mg/l CdCl2 through drinking water for 14 weeks and assessed for 
      hippocampus-dependent memory. A separate cohort was sacrificed immediately after 
      exposure and used for Cd measurements and immunostaining. The peak blood Cd was 
      0.3-0.4 µg/l, within levels found in the U.S. general population. All Cd-treated 
      animals exhibited spatial working memory deficits in the novel object location 
      test. This deficit manifested earlier in ApoE4-KI mice than in ApoE3-KI within 
      the same sex and earlier in males than females within the same genotype. ApoE4-KI 
      but not ApoE3-KI mice exhibited reduced spontaneous alternation later in life in 
      the T-maze test. Finally, Cd exposure impaired neuronal differentiation of 
      adult-born neurons in the hippocampus of male ApoE4-KI mice. These data suggest 
      that a GxE between ApoE4 and Cd exposure leads to accelerated cognitive 
      impairment and that impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis may be one of the 
      underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, male mice were more susceptible than female 
      mice to this GxE effect when animals were young.

      posttrauma-born hippocampal neurons while inhibiting ectopic migration following 
      traumatic brain injury.

AB  - Cellular damage associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) manifests in motor 
      and cognitive dysfunction following injury. Experimental models of TBI reveal 
      cell death in the granule cell layer (GCL) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus 
      acutely after injury. Adult-born neurons residing in the neurogenic niche of the 
      GCL, the subgranular zone, are particularly vulnerable. Injury-induced 
      proliferation of neural progenitors in the subgranular zone supports recovery of 
      the immature neuron population, but their development and localization may be 
      altered, potentially affecting long-term survival. Here we show that increasing 
      hippocampal levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) is sufficient to 
      promote end-stage maturity of posttrauma-born neurons and improve cognition 
      following TBI. Mice with conditional overexpression of astrocyte-specific IGF1 
      and wild-type mice received controlled cortical impact or sham injury and 
      bromo-2'-deoxyuridine injections for 7d after injury to label proliferating 
      cells. IGF1 overexpression increased the number of GCL neurons born acutely after 
      trauma that survived 6 weeks to maturity (NeuN+BrdU+), and enhanced their outward 
      migration into the GCL while significantly reducing the proportion localized 
      ectopically to the hilus and molecular layer. IGF1 selectively affected neurons, 
      without increasing the persistence of posttrauma-proliferated glia in the dentate 
      gyrus. IGF1 overexpressing animals performed better during radial arm water maze 
      reversal testing, a neurogenesis-dependent cognitive test. These findings 
      demonstrate the ability of IGF1 to promote the long-term survival and appropriate 
      localization of granule neurons born acutely after a TBI, and suggest these new 
      neurons contribute to improved cognitive function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of "Huayu Tongluo"(Blood-stasis Dispersing and 
      Meridian-collateral Dredging) moxibustion on the delayed memory and expression of 
      Nestin and Doublecortin (DCX) proteins in the hippocampus in vascular dementia 
      (VD) rats in the view of neurogenesis produced by intracerebral transplantation 
      of neural stem cells (NSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). METHODS: 
      Healthy male Wistar rats were randomized into control group, VD model 
      group,NSCs＋EPCs group and NSCs＋EPCs moxibustion group. The VD model was 
      established by using a modified 2-vessels occlusion method, and neurogenesis was 
      produced by transplantation of NSCs＋EPCs (2×10(6)cell/10 µL) into the lateral 
      ventricle for rats of the NSCs＋EPCs groups 3 days after successful VD-modeling. 
      Moxibustion was applied to "Dazhui" (GV 14), "Baihui" (GV 20) and "Shenting" (GV 
      24) once daily for 21 days with an interval of one day between every two 7 days. 
      The Morris Water Maze was used to test the rat's delayed memory ability before 
      and 24 h after the treatment. The expression of Nestin and DCX proteins in the 
      hippocampus tissues was detected using double-labeled immunofluorescence 
      technique. RESULTS: Following modeling, Morris Water Maze tests showed that the 
      average escape latency of location navigation task was significantly prolonged in 
      VD rats(P<0.008)and the times of target platform crossing (spatial probing task) 
      within 120 s were remarkably reduced in VD rats (P<0.008). Compared with 
      pre-treatment in the same one group, the escape latency of NSCs＋EPCs and 
      NSCs＋EPCs moxibustion groups were considerably reduced (P<0.05), and the average 
      times of target platform crossing of the NSCs＋EPCs moxibustion group were 
      markedly increased(P<0.05). The effect of NSCs＋EPCs moxibustion was evidently 
      superior to that of simple NSCs＋EPCs in shortening the escape latency (P<0.008). 
      The expression levels of Nestin protein were significantly higher in the 
      NSCs＋EPCs moxibustion group after 1 and 3 period treatment than those in the 
      NSCs＋EPCs group (P<0.05)．. CONCLUSION: Moxibustion intervention is able to 
      improve the delayed memory in VD rats, which may be related to its effect in 
      up-regulating the expression of hippocampal Nestin and DCX proteins within 15 
      days via accelerating neurogenesis.

TI  - Maternal sevoflurane exposure induces temporary defects in interkinetic nuclear 
      migration of radial glial progenitors in the fetal cerebral cortex through the 
      Notch signalling pathway.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effects of general anaesthetics on fetal brain development remain 
      elusive. Radial glial progenitors (RGPs) generate the majority of neurons in 
      developing brains. Here, we evaluated the acute alterations in RGPs after 
      maternal sevoflurane exposure. METHODS: Pregnant mice were exposed to 2.5% 
      sevoflurane for 6 hours on gestational day 14.5. Interkinetic nuclear migration 
      (INM) of RGPs in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the fetal brain was evaluated by 
      thymidine analogues labelling. Cell fate of RGP progeny was determined by 
      immunostaining using various neural markers. The Morris water maze (MWM) was used 
      to assess the neurocognitive behaviours of the offspring. RNA sequencing 
      (RNA-Seq) was performed for the potential mechanism, and the potential mechanism 
      validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), Western blot and rescue 
      experiments. Furthermore, INM was examined in human embryonic stem cell 
      (hESC)-derived 3D cerebral organoids. RESULTS: Maternal sevoflurane exposure 
      induced temporary abnormities in INM, and disturbed the cell cycle progression of 
      RGPs in both rodents and cerebral organoids without cell fate alternation. 
      RNA-Seq analysis, qPCR and Western blot showed that the Notch signalling pathway 
      was a potential downstream target. Reactivation of Notch by Jag1 and NICD 
      overexpression rescued the defects in INM. Young adult offspring showed no 
      obvious cognitive impairments in MWM. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal sevoflurane exposure 
      during neurogenic period temporarily induced abnormal INM of RGPs by targeting 
      the Notch signalling pathway without inducing long-term effects on RGP progeny 
      cell fate or offspring cognitive behaviours. More importantly, the defects of INM 
      in hESC-derived cerebral organoids provide a novel insight into the effects of 
      general anaesthesia on human brain development.

TI  - Cdc42 signaling regulated by dopamine D2 receptor correlatively links specific 
      brain regions of hippocampus to cocaine addiction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hippocampus plays critical roles in drug addiction. Cocaine-induced 
      modifications in dopamine receptor function and the downstream signaling are 
      important regulation mechanisms in cocaine addiction. Rac regulates actin 
      filament accumulation while Cdc42 stimulates the formation of filopodia and 
      neurite outgrowth. Based on the region specific roles of small GTPases in brain, 
      we focused on the hippocampal subregions to detect the regulation of Cdc42 
      signaling in long-term morphological and behavioral adaptations to cocaine. 
      METHODS: Genetically modified mouse models of Cdc42, dopamine receptor D1 (D1R) 
      and D2 (D2R) and expressed Cdc42 point mutants that are defective in binding to 
      and activation of its downstream effector molecules PAK and N-WASP were 
      generated, respectively, in CA1 or dentate gyrus (DG) subregion. RESULTS: Cocaine 
      induced upregulation of Cdc42 signaling activity. Cdc42 knockout or mutants 
      blocked cocaine-induced increase in spine plasticity in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal 
      neurons, leading to a decreased conditional place preference (CPP)-associated 
      memories and spatial learning and memory in water maze. Cdc42 knockout or mutants 
      promoted cocaine-induced loss of neurogenesis in DG, leading to a decreased 
      CPP-associated memories and spatial learning and memory in water maze. 
      Furthermore, by using D1R knockout, D2R knockout, and D2R/Cdc42 double knockout 
      mice, we found that D2R, but not D1R, regulated Cdc42 signaling in 
      cocaine-induced neural plasticity and behavioral changes. CONCLUSIONS: Cdc42 acts 
      downstream of D2R in the hippocampus and plays an important role in 
      cocaine-induced neural plasticity through N-WASP and PAK-LIMK-Cofilin, and Cdc42 
      signaling pathway correlatively links specific brain regions (CA1, dentate gyrus) 
      to cocaine-induced CPP behavior.

AB  - AIMS: Nerve growth factor (NGF) has been reported to prevent neuronal damage and 
      contributes to the functional recovery in animal brain injury models and human 
      ischemic disease as well. We aimed to investigate a potential therapeutic effect 
      of NGF gene treatment in ischemic stroke and to estimate the functional recovery 
      both at the cellular and cognitive levels in an ischemia rat model. METHODS: 
      After microinjection of pseudolentivirus-delivered β-NGF into an established 
      ischemic stroke model in rats (tMCAO), we estimated neuronal cell apoptosis with 
      TUNEL labeling and neurogenesis by cell proliferation marker Ki67 staining in 
      both ischemic core and penumbra of striatum. Furthermore, we used behavioral 
      functional tests, Morris water maze performance, to evaluate cognitive functional 
      recovery in vivo and propose a potential underlying mechanism. RESULTS: We found 
      that pseudolentivirus-mediated delivery of β-NGF gene into the brain induced high 
      expression in striatum of the infarct core area after ischemia in rats. The β-NGF 
      overexpression in the striatal infarction core after ischemia not only improved 
      neuronal survival by reducing cell apoptosis and increasing cell proliferation, 
      but also rescued cognitive functional impairment through upregulation of GAP-43 
      protein expression in tMCAO rat model of ischemia. CONCLUSION: This study 
      demonstrates a potential β-NGF gene therapy by utilization of pseudolentivirus in 
      ischemia and indicates future applications of NGF gene treatment in ischemic 
      patients.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease and the most 
      common type of dementia. Although it is still incurable, stem cell replacement 
      therapy provides new hope for AD. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells 
      (hUC-MSCs) have multiple differentiation potentials, which can differentiate into 
      cholinergic-like neurons and promote the release of acetylcholine. Brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can also promote neurogenesis and synaptic formation, 
      reduce oxidative stress and cell death. Therefore, we investigated the 
      therapeutic effects of BDNF modified hUC-MSCs-derived cholinergic-like neurons in 
      AD rats in this study. To make AD models, 1 μl beta amyloid (Aβ)(1-42) was 
      injected into the right hippocampus of the rats. After two weeks, the 
      hUC-MSCs-derived cholinergic-like neurons null cells or overexpressing BDNF cells 
      delivered by lentiviralvectors were slowly injected into the right hippocampus of 
      the AD rats. After 8 weeks of transplantation, Morris water maze test, Western 
      blotting, Immunohistochemistry, Immunofluorescence assay and TdT mediated dUTP 
      Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) detection were performed. Transplantation of BDNF 
      modified hUC-MSCs-derived cholinergic-like neurons significantly improved spatial 
      learning and memory abilities in the AD rats, increased the release of 
      acetylcholine and ChAT expression in the hippocampus, enhanced the activation of 
      astrocytes and microglia, reduced the expression of Aβ and recombinant human 
      beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1), inhibited neuronal apoptosis, and 
      promoted neurogenesis. Our results demonstrate that BDNF modified 
      hUC-MSCs-derived cholinergic-like neurons might be a promising therapeutic 
      strategy for AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of dementia that induced by 
      aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in brain tissue. With high structural and 
      functional plasticity, hippocampus plays fundamental roles in cognitive 
      regulation. Moreover, impaired hippocampal functions present during early onset 
      of AD. Hence, targeting on improving hippocampal plasticity would be recognized 
      as the effective strategy in AD therapy. Physical exercise is widely encouraged 
      healthy life style. However, whether exercise could reserve the neural 
      dysfunctions in AD model and the possible neurobiological mechanism still need 
      for better understanding. In current study, we created the AD model by 
      intra-hippocampal injection of Aβ. Afterward, mice were administrated with 
      treadmill running to mimic the physical exercise. Our results show that physical 
      exercise prevented the Aβ-induced cognitive deficits in object recognition task 
      and the Morris water maze. Morphological studies reveal physical exercise 
      increased the adult neurogenesis and release the immune-response in hippocampal 
      dentate gyrus (DG) region. In addition, physical exercise released the 
      immune-response by decreasing the level of cytokines and population of astrocytes 
      that elevated by injection of Aβ. We also found that physical exercise changed 
      the modification of ERK, p38 and JNK, which recognized as the representative MAPK 
      signaling involving with hippocampal neural functions. In conclusion, exercise 
      serves as a potential strategy to prevent the development of AD by regulating 
      adult neurogenesis and brain immune-activity via controlling MAPK signaling.

AB  - The imbalance between mitochondrial fusion and fission has been implicated in 
      cerebral ischemia and several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the role of 
      mitochondrial fission in traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains poorly understood. 
      Mitochondrial fission is mediated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which is 
      highly expressed in the nervous system. In the present study, we investigated the 
      changes in Drp1 expression in the ipsilateral hippocampus of rats after TBI and 
      the effects of Mdivi-1 (a selective inhibitor of Drp1) as a post-insult treatment 
      for TBI. Our findings showed that the protein levels of Drp1 were increased at 
      6 h and peaked at 12 h post-TBI, but we did not observe Drp1 phosphorylation at 
      Ser616, Ser637, Ser40 or Ser44 during this process. We examined the effect of 
      Mdivi-1 on trauma-induced brain damage in both vitro and vivo. In cells, Mdivi-1 
      significantly attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) 
      dissipation in PC-12 cells. Three days of Mdivi-1 treatment significantly reduced 
      the cortical lesion volume, blood-brain barrier permeability, brain edema and 
      oxidative stress. Mdivi-1 reduced activated caspase-3 release in the cortical 
      border zone and hippocampal dentate gyrus three days after TBI. Furthermore, 
      treatment with Mdivi-1 for 4 weeks rescued neurogenesis in DG and attenuated 
      hippocampal atrophy. Regarding behavioral outcomes, Mdivi-1-treated TBI rats 
      showed a significant improvement in water maze acquisition and retention compared 
      with the saline-treated TBI rats. Moreover, Mdivi-1 treatment reduced 
      anxiety-like behavior in an open-field test. Our results support the notion that 
      Mdivi-1 provides brain protection and improves the behavioral performance in TBI 
      rats.

AB  - Chronic exposures to high-fat diets are linked to neuropathological changes that 
      culminate in obesity-related cognitive dysfunction and brain alteration. 
      Learning, memory performance, and executive function are the main domains 
      affected by an obesogenic diet. There are limited effective therapies for 
      addressing cognitive deficits. Thus, it is important to identify additional and 
      alternative therapies. In African traditional medicine, Gnidia glauca has 
      putative efficacy in the management of obesity and associated complications. The 
      use of Gnidia glauca is largely based on its long-term traditional use. Its 
      therapeutic application has not been accompanied by sufficient scientific 
      evaluation to validate its use. Therefore, the current study sought to explore 
      the modulatory effects of dichloromethane leaf extracts of Gnidia glauca on 
      cognitive function in the high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced obese rats. Obesity was 
      induced by feeding the rats with prepared HFD and water ad libitum for 6 weeks. 
      The in vivo antiobesity effects were determined by oral administration of G. 
      glauca at dosage levels of 200, 250, and 300 mg/kg body weight in HFD-induced 
      obese rats from the 6(th) to the 12(th) weeks. The Lee obesity index was used as 
      a diagnostic criterion of obesity. The Morris water maze was employed to test 
      spatial learning and memory retention in rats. The results indicated that Gnidia 
      glauca showed potent antiobesity effects as indicated in the reduction of body 
      weight and obesity index in extract-treated rats. Moreover, Gnidia glauca 
      exhibited cognitive-enhancing effects in obese rats. The positive influences on 
      cognitive functions might be attributed to the extracts' phytochemicals that have 
      been suggested to confer protection against obesity-induced oxidative damage, 
      reduction of central inflammation, and increased neurogenesis. The therapeutic 
      effects observed suggest that Gnidia glauca might be an alternative to current 
      medications for the symptomatic complications of obesity, such as learning and 
      memory loss. Further studies are therefore needed to establish its toxicity 
      profiles.

TI  - Dexmedetomidine Attenuates Methotrexate-Induced Neurotoxicity and Memory Deficits 
      in Rats through Improving Hippocampal Neurogenesis: The Role of 
      miR-15a/ROCK-1/ERK1/2/CREB/BDNF Pathway Modulation.

AB  - Methotrexate (MTX) is a widely used neurotoxic drug with broad antineoplastic and 
      immunosuppressant spectra. However, the exact molecular mechanisms by which MTX 
      inhibits hippocampal neurogenesis are yet unclear. Dexmedetomidine (Dex), an 
      α2-adrenergic receptor agonist, has recently shown neuroprotective effects; 
      however, its full mechanism is unexplored. This study investigated the potential 
      of Dex to mitigate MTX-induced neurotoxicity and memory impairment in rats and 
      the possible role of the miR-15a/ROCK-1/ERK1/2/CREB/BDNF pathway. Notably, no 
      former studies have linked this pathway to MTX-induced neurotoxicity. Male 
      Sprague Dawley rats were placed into four groups. Group 1 received saline i.p. 
      daily and i.v. on days 8 and 15. Group 2 received Dex at 10 μg/kg/day i.p. for 30 
      days. Group 3 received MTX at 75 mg/kg i.v. on days 8 and 15, followed by four 
      i.p. doses of leucovorin at 6 mg/kg after 18 h and 3 mg/kg after 26, 42, and 50 
      h. Group 4 received MTX and leucovorin as in group 3 and Dex daily dosages as in 
      group 2. Bioinformatic analysis identified the association of miR-15a with 
      ROCK-1/ERK1/2/CREB/BDNF and neurogenesis. MTX lowered hippocampal doublecortin 
      and Ki-67, two markers of neurogenesis. This was associated with the 
      downregulation of miR-15a, upregulation of its target ROCK-1, and reduction in 
      the downstream ERK1/2/CREB/BDNF pathway, along with disturbed hippocampal redox 
      state. Novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests demonstrated the 
      MTX-induced memory deficiencies. Dex co-treatment reversed the MTX-induced 
      behavioral, biochemical, and histological alterations in the rats. These 
      neuroprotective actions could be partly mediated through modulating the 
      miR-15a/ROCK-1/ERK1/2/CREB/BDNF pathway, which enhances hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Schizophrenia is a chronic mental illness presented by cognitive 
      deficits that precede its positive and negative symptoms. Sonic hedgehog 
      (Shh)-pathway contributes to its pathophysiology. Shh has a role in neurogenesis 
      as it regulates proliferation and survival of neural cells. In this study, 
      effects of the anti-psychotics Amisulpride and/or Aripiprazole on the Shh-pathway 
      and its relation to cognitive functions and neurogenesis in a rat model of 
      schizophrenia were tested. METHODS: 60 male Wistar rats were allocated into the 
      following groups: control, socially isolated, amisulpride and/or 
      aripiprazole-treated groups. Rats were then subjected to behavioral, biochemical, 
      and histopathological tests to assess the impact of these drugs on Shh-pathway. 
      KEY FINDINGS: Cognitive-dysfunction was evidenced in socially isolated group in 
      novel object, three-chamber, and Morris water maze tests, associated by 
      disorganised Shh-pathway proteins levels concentrations, increased glial 
      fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-stained astrocytes. Treated groups favorably 
      reversed these changes evidenced by increased Shh, transmembrane patched-1 and 
      smoothened, glioma-associated-oncogene (GLI)-1 levels, dopamine-1 receptors and 
      brain derived neurotrophic factor, and decreased GLI-3 protein, GFAP immune 
      reaction in astrocytes and inflammatory markers compared to socially isolated 
      group. CONCLUSION: Amisulpride and/or aripiprazole have a favorable role in 
      turning on Shh-pathway with subsequent beneficial cognitive and neurogenesis 
      effects.

AB  - Brain is a site of diabetic end-organ damage. Diabetes-associated cognitive 
      dysfunction, referred as "diabetic encephalopathy" (DE) has been coined for the 
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus showing decline in their cognitive 
      function, especially weak episodic memory, cognitive inflexibility and poor 
      psychomotor performance leading towards Alzheimer's disease. Current evidence 
      supported that aberrant synapses, energy metabolism imbalance, advanced glycation 
      end products (AGEs) accumulation and Tau hyperphosphorylation are associated with 
      cognition deficits induced by diabetes. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), an endogenous 
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) agonist, has 
      anti-hyperlipidemia, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities. However, 
      the effect of OEA on DE is unknown. Therefore, we tested its influence against 
      cognitive dysfunction in high fat diet and streptozotocin (HFD + STZ)-induced 
      diabetic C57BL/6J and PPARα(-)(-/-) mice using Morris water maze (MWM) test. 
      Neuron staining, dementia markers and neuroplasticity in the hippocampus were 
      assessed to evaluate the neuropathological changes. The results showed that 
      chronic OEA treatment significantly lowered hyperglycemia, recovered cognitive 
      performance, reduced dementia markers, and inhibited hippocampal neuron loss and 
      neuroplasticity impairments in diabetic mice. In contrast, the changes in MWM 
      performance and neuron loss were not observed in PPARα knockout mice via OEA 
      administration. These results indicated that OEA may provide a potential 
      alternative therapeutic for DE by activating PPARα signaling.

TI  - Freshly Thawed Cryobanked Human Neural Stem Cells Engraft within Endogenous

      Injury.

AB  - Human neural stem cells (hNSCs) have potential as a cell therapy after traumatic 
      brain injury (TBI). While various studies have demonstrated the efficacy of NSCs 
      from ongoing culture, there is a significant gap in our understanding of freshly 
      thawed cells from cryobanked stocks-a more clinically relevant source. To address 
      these shortfalls, the therapeutic potential of our previously validated Shef-6.0 
      human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived hNSC line was tested after long-term 
      cryostorage and thawing before transplant. Immunodeficient athymic nude rats 
      received a moderate unilateral controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. At four 
      weeks post-injury, 6 × 10(5) freshly thawed hNSCs were transplanted into six 
      injection sites (two ipsi- and four contra-lateral) with 53.4% of cells surviving 
      three months post-transplant. Interestingly, most hNSCs were engrafted in the 
      meninges and the lining of lateral ventricles, associated with high CXCR4 
      expression and a chemotactic response to SDF1alpha (CXCL12). While some expressed 
      markers of neuron, astrocyte, and oligodendrocyte lineages, the majority remained 
      progenitors, identified through doublecortin expression (78.1%). Importantly, 
      transplantation resulted in improved spatial learning and memory in Morris water 
      maze navigation and reduced risk taking in an elevated plus maze. Investigating 
      potential mechanisms of action, we identified an increase in ipsilateral host 
      hippocampus cornu ammonis (CA) neuron survival, contralateral dentate gyrus (DG) 
      volume, and DG neural progenitor morphology as well as a reduction in 
      neuroinflammation. Together, these findings validate the potential of hNSCs to 
      improve function after TBI and demonstrate that long-term biobanking of cells and 
      thawing aliquots before use may be suitable for clinical deployment.

TI  - Assessing the Effects of Redox Modifier MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ on Cognition and 
      Hippocampal Physiology Following Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, and Paclitaxel 
      Treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer can induce cognitive 
      impairments often involving oxidative stress. The brain, as a whole, is 
      susceptible to oxidative stress due to its high-energy requirements, limited 
      anaerobic respiration capacities, and limited antioxidant defenses. The goal of 
      the current study was to determine if the manganese porphyrin superoxide 
      dismutase mimetic MnTnBuOE-2-PyP (MnBuOE) could ameliorate the effects of 
      doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel (AC-T) on mature dendrite 
      morphology and cognitive function. METHODS: Four-month-old female C57BL/6 mice 
      received intraperitoneal injections of chemotherapy followed by subcutaneous 
      injections of MnBuOE. Four weeks following chemotherapy treatment, mice were 
      tested for hippocampus-dependent cognitive performance in the Morris water maze. 
      After testing, brains were collected for Golgi staining and molecular analyses. 
      RESULTS: MnBuOE treatment preserved spatial memory during the Morris water-maze. 
      MnBuOE/AC-T showed spatial memory retention during all probe trials. AC-T 
      treatment significantly impaired spatial memory retention in the first and third 
      probe trial (no platform). AC-T treatment decreased dendritic length in the Cornu 
      Ammonis 1 (CA1) and dentate gyrus (DG) areas of the hippocampus while AC-T/MnBuOE 
      maintained dendritic length. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed affected 
      protein networks associated with cell morphology and behavior functions in both 
      the AC-T and AC-T/MnBuOE treatment groups.

AB  - One of the most promising treatments for neurodegenerative diseases is the stem 
      cell therapy; however, there are still some limitations in the treatment of 
      Alzheimer's disease. In this study, superparamagnetic nanoparticles composed of 
      magnetic Fe(3)O(4) and polydopamine shells were used to label human umbilical 
      cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) in order to increase the targeting of 
      hUC-MSCs. Our data suggested that Fe(3)O(4)@PDA labeling increase the efficiency 
      of hUC-MSCs entering the brain. Moreover, the water maze test showed that 
      compared with hUC-MSCs only, Fe(3)O(4)@PDA-labeled hUC-MSCs improved the 
      cognitive ability of APP/PS1 transgenic mice more significantly. Other 
      experimental data showed that the expression of essential proteins in the 
      hippocampus, such as Aβ, synaptophysin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, are 
      affected by Fe(3)O(4)@PDA coated-hUC-MSCs. The regulation of Fe(3)O(4)@PDA 
      coated-hUC-MSCs could improve the memory and cognitive ability of AD mice by 
      excessive generation of neuroprotective factors, which might be considered a 
      viable therapy to treat AD.

TI  - Therapeutic Role of microRNAs of Small Extracellular Vesicles from Human 
      Mesenchymal Stromal/Stem Cells in Treatment of Experimental Traumatic Brain 
      Injury.
LID - 10.1089/neu.2022.0296 [doi]
AB  - Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC)-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) 
      possess therapeutic potential for treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The 
      essential role of micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) underlying the beneficial 
      effects of MSC-derived sEVs for treatment of TBI remains elusive. The present 
      study was designed to investigate the role of microRNAs in sEVs from MSCs with 
      Argonaute 2 knockdown (Ago2-KD) in neurological recovery, neuroinflammation, and 
      neurovascular remodeling in TBI rats. Therapeutic effects of sEVs derived from 
      naïve MSCs (naïve-sEV), MSCs transfected with a vector carrying scramble control 
      short hairpin RNA (shRNA; vector-sEV), and MSCs transfected with a lentiviral 
      vector-based shRNA against Ago2 to knock down Ago2 (Ago2-KD-sEV) were determined 
      in adult male rats subjected to a moderate TBI induced by controlled cortical 
      impact (CCI). sEVs (naïve-sEV, vector-sEV, and Ago2-KD-sEV) or vehicle 
      (phosphate-buffered solution [PBS]) were given intravenously 1 day post-injury 
      (PI). Multiple neurological functional tests were performed weekly PI for 5 
      weeks. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed for spatial learning and 
      memory 31-35 days PI. All animals were euthanized 5 weeks PI and the brains were 
      collected for analyses of lesion volume, cell loss, neurovascular remodeling, and 
      neuroinflammation. Ago2-KD reduced global sEV miRNA levels. Compared with the 
      vehicle treatment, both naïve-sEV and vector-sEV treatments significantly 
      improved functional recovery, reduced hippocampal neuronal cell loss, inhibited 
      neuroinflammation, and promoted neurovascular remodeling (angiogenesis and 
      neurogenesis). However, Ago2-KD-sEV treatment had a significantly less 
      therapeutic effect on all the parameters measured above than did naïve-sEV and 
      vector-sEV treatments. The therapeutic effects of Ago2-KD-sEV were comparable to 
      that of vehicle treatment. Our findings demonstrate that attenuation of Ago2 
      protein in MSCs reduces miRNAs in MSC-derived sEVs and abolishes exosome 
      treatment-induced beneficial effects in TBI recovery, suggesting that miRNAs in 
      MSC-derived sEVs play an essential role in reducing neuronal cell loss, 
      inhibiting neuroinflammation, and augmenting angiogenesis and neurogenesis, as 
      well as improving functional recovery in TBI. The findings underscore the 
      important role of miRNAs in MSC-derived sEVs in the treatment of TBI.

TI  - Progesterone treatment in rats after severe global cerebral ischemia promotes 
      hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis and functional recovery.
PG  - 429-436
LID - 10.1080/01616412.2019.1576356 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rats treated with progesterone (P4) after ischemia show an adequate 
      functional performance despite a significant loss of hippocampal pyramidal 
      neurons, suggesting that P4 could favour a permissive microenvironment for 
      cerebral plasticity mechanisms. The possibility of P4 treatment promoting the 
      survival of newly generated hippocampal neurons, in relation to the performance 
      of ischemic rats in a spatial learning task, was assessed in this study. METHODS: 
      Adult male rats were subjected to a severe global cerebral ischemia episode 
      (30 min) and treated with P4 or its vehicle at 15 min, 2, 6, 24, 48 and 72 h of 
      reperfusion. From day 4 to 8 post-ischemia 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was 
      administered to label proliferating cells. Twenty-one days post-ischemia, the 
      rats were exposed to the Morris water maze to assess behavioral parameters of 
      spatial learning and memory. Subsequently, the brain was perfusion-fixed and 
      immunofluorescence procedures were performed to quantify the number of new mature 
      neurons (BrdU(+)/NeuN(+)) in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. RESULTS: 
      Rats subjected to severe global cerebral ischemia and treated with P4 had a 
      significantly better performance in spatial learning-memory tests, than those 
      treated with vehicle, and a significantly higher number of new mature neurons 
      (BrdU(+)/NeuN(+)) in the DG. CONCLUSION: These findings show that post-ischemia 
      P4 treatment, following an episode of severe global cerebral ischemia, promotes 
      the survival of newly generated hippocampal neurons in the DG, which may be one 
      of the mechanisms of cerebral plasticity induced by the hormone, that underlie a 
      successful functional performance in learning and memory tests.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disorder that 
      currently remains extremely disabling. Recent work has shown that deep brain 
      stimulation (DBS) has promising effects in AD patients. In parallel to the 
      clinical trials, we investigated the impact of chronic DBS in 3xTg mice, a 
      well-established animal model of AD. METHODS: AD mice were assigned to control 
      (Cont), non-stimulation (NS) and stimulation (DBS) groups, along with age matched 
      wild type controls (WT-Cont). Bilateral electrodes were implanted in the 
      entorhinal cortex to deliver chronic high frequency stimulation for 25 days. 
      Animals were tested in memory behavioral tasks, with post-mortem measurements of 
      pathological markers. RESULTS: We found that chronic DBS in AD mice normalized 
      their impaired performance in the Morris water maze task to that of the WT group 
      in the probe test. In the novel object and novel place preference tasks, AD-DBS 
      mice spent more time at the novel object and novice location compared to AD-NS 
      mice. These cognitive improvements in AD-DBS mice were associated with DBS 
      induced increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, a significant reduction in 
      β-amyloid plaques, a reduction in CA-1 cellular β-amyloid-42 levels, decreased 
      cortical total-tau and phosphorylated-tau, along with decreased hippocampal 
      total-tau. CONCLUSION: Overall, we show that chronic DBS of the entorhinal cortex 
      in AD mice improves both memory and AD specific pathological markers. These 
      results support further testing of DBS as a potential treatment in AD patients.

AB  - Sleep disturbance can result in memory impairment, and both sleep and hippocampal 
      memory formation are maintained by circadian clock genes. Although preoperative 
      sleep deprivation is known to be an independent risk factor for postoperative 
      cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after inhalation anesthesia, the circadian 
      mechanisms involved are currently unclear. To examine this issue, we constructed 
      models of rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (RSD) and POCD after sevoflurane 
      inhalation, to evaluate the circadian mechanisms underlying preoperative sleep 
      deprivation-induced POCD after sevoflurane inhalation. Morris water maze probe 
      test performance revealed that RSD aggravated the hippocampal-dependent memory 
      impairment induced by sevoflurane anesthesia, and the recovery period of memory 
      impairment was prolonged for more than a week by sleep deprivation. Western blot 
      analysis revealed that sleep deprivation inhibited hippocampal Bmal1 and Egr1 
      expression for more than 7 days after sevoflurane inhalation. Importantly, 
      hippocampal Per2 expression levels were first decreased by sevoflurane inhalation 
      then increased from the third day by sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation 
      enhanced the expression of hippocampal inflammatory factors IL-1β and IL-6 after 
      sevoflurane inhalation. In addition, sevoflurane inhalation activated the plasma 
      expression of S100β and IL-6, particularly after sleep deprivation. Sleep 
      deprivation aggravated pathogenic impairment of pyramidal neurons and activated 
      astrocytes in CA1 after sevoflurane inhalation. These results suggest that 
      preoperative RSD aggravates hippocampal memory impairment by enhancing 
      neuroinflammatory injuries after sevoflurane inhalation, which is related to 
      hippocampal clock gene abnormalities.

TI  - Hippocampal Mechanisms Underlying Impairment in Spatial Learning Long After 
      Establishment of Noise-Induced Hearing Loss in CBA Mice.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.3389/fnsys.2018.00035 [doi]
LID - 35
AB  - Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has been demonstrated in many clinical reports 
      as a risk factor that promotes the development of cognitive impairment. However, 
      the underlying neurological mechanisms are not clear. Noise exposure is one of 
      the most common causes of SNHL. Although noise exposure causes relatively less 
      damage to general health as compared with other methods for creating hearing loss 
      (such as ototoxicity), it does impair cognitive function. Many studies have shown 
      that the noise-induced cognitive impairment occur via the oxidative stress 
      induced by the noise. In those studies, the effects of the noise-induced hearing 
      loss induced (NIHL) were not addressed. Previously, we have demonstrated in the 
      CBA/CaJ mouse model that oxidative stress was transient after a brief noise 
      exposure, but the NIHL was permanent. In addition, NIHL was followed by a 
      declined cognitive function and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis that were 
      developed long after the oxidative stress disappeared. Therefore, NIHL can cause 
      cognitive impairment independent of its stress effect and can serve as a model to 
      investigate the relationship between hearing loss and the development of 
      cognitive impairment. In the present study, we further demonstrated that the 
      oxidative stress produced by the brief noise exposure did not damage the stem 
      cell bank of hippocampus that was evaluated shortly after the noise exposure. In 
      addition to the reduction in the rate of cell proliferation in hippocampus that 
      was found previously, we found that the NIHL significantly reduced the promoting 
      effect of learning activity on various stages of hippocampal neurogenesis, 
      accompanied by the reduction in learning-induced expression of immediate early 
      genes (IEGs) in hippocampus. Since the MWM-tested spatial function does not 
      directly require auditory input, the results provide evidence for the maintenance 
      role of auditory input on the cognitive function; the reduction of IEG expression 
      that is required in memory-formation may be the initial step in blocking the 
      effect of learning activity on neurogenesis in subjects with NIHL.

TI  - Cannabinoid type 2 receptor agonist JWH-133, attenuates Okadaic acid induced 
      spatial memory impairment and neurodegeneration in rats.

AB  - AIM: Cannabinoid system has various physiological roles such as neurogenesis, 
      synaptic plasticity and emotional state regulation in the body. The presence of 
      cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2), a member of the cannabinoid system, was 
      detected in different regions of the brain. CB2 receptor plays a role in 
      neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. We aimed to determine the 
      possible effect of CB2 agonist JWH-133 in Okadaic acid (OKA)-induced 
      neurodegeneration model mimicking Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through tau pathology. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 40 Sprague Dawley male rats were divided 
      into 4 groups (Control, Sham, OKA, OKA + JWH-133). Bilateral 
      intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of 200 ng OKA was performed in the OKA 
      group. In the OKA + JWH-133 group, injection of JWH-133 (0.2 mg/kg) was performed 
      intraperitoneally for 13 days different from the group of OKA. Morris water maze 
      test was used to evaluate the spatial memory. Levels of caspase-3, phosphorylated 
      tau (ser396), amyloid beta (Aβ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and 
      interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) levels in brain cortex; and the hippocampus regions 
      were examined by immunohistochemical methods. KEY FINDINGS: In the OKA group, 
      caspase-3, phosphorylated tau (ser396), Aβ, IL-1β levels were higher in the 
      cortex and hippocampus than in the other groups. The implementation of the 
      JWH-133 reversed the increments in these parameters, and also prevented spatial 
      memory impairment. SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we found that the administration 
      of the CB2 receptor agonist JWH-133 in this study reduced neurodegeneration, 
      neuroinflammation, and spatial memory impairment in the OKA-induced Alzheimer's 
      Disease model.

AB  - A high-fat diet (HFD) is known to induce metabolic disturbances that may lead to 
      cognitive impairment. In the present study, we investigated whether a regular 
      treadmill exercise program would improve HFD-induced hippocampal-dependent memory 
      deficits in C57BL/6 mice. Weight gain and hepatic triglyceride levels were 
      profoundly elevated following administration of a 60% HFD for 23 weeks, and this 
      change was attenuated by 23-weeks of treadmill running. The exercise regimen 
      attenuated impairments in memory function of HFD-fed mice in a water maze test 
      and recovered HFD-induced anti-neurogenic effects as shown by 
      immunohistochemistry data with Ki-67 and doublecortin (DCX) antibodies. Moreover, 
      the treadmill exercise resulted in anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and 
      neuroprotective effects in the HFD-fed brain. The exercise inhibited HFD-induced 
      microglial activation, expression of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis 
      factor-α and interleukin-1β), and NF-κB activity in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the 
      hippocampus. In addition, the exercise reduced malondialdehyde levels elevated by 
      HFD and recovered antioxidant superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels in 
      hippocampal DG of HFD-mice. The exercise also reduced the number of apoptotic 
      cells induced by HFD, as shown by TUNEL staining in the DG region. Finally, we 
      demonstrated that the thioredoxin-1 (TRX-1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
      (BDNF) levels were recovered by exercise, which was demonstrated to act via 
      β2-adrenergic receptor enriched in synaptosomes of the DG. Therefore, our data 
      collectively suggests that regular exercise may be a promising approach to 
      preventing HFD-induced memory impairments via anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and 
      neuroprotective mechanisms in the hippocampal DG region.

TI  - Nogo-A/Pir-B/TrkB Signaling Pathway Activation Inhibits Neuronal Survival and 
      Axonal Regeneration After Experimental Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Rats.
PG  - 360-370
LID - 10.1007/s12031-019-01365-1 [doi]
AB  - Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) leads to widespread pathological lesions in the 
      brain, especially impacting neuronal survival and axonal regeneration. This study 
      aimed to elucidate whether the Nogo-A (a myelin-related protein)/paired 
      immunoglobulin-like receptor B (Pir-B)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) 
      pathway could exert a regulatory effect in ICH. An ICH model was first 
      established in Sprague Dawley rats, followed by different administrations of 
      vehicle, k252a, or NSC 87877. The Morris water maze test was performed to observe 
      ICH-induced cognitive dysfunction in rats. Rats in the ICH + NSC 87877 group 
      showed better cognitive performance compared with those injected with vehicle or 
      k252a. Neurobehavioral scores were identical. By harvesting brain tissues at 
      different time points after ICH, we detected the expression levels of Nogo-A and 
      PirB with western blot and immunofluorescence and found that they were markedly 
      upregulated at 48 h after ICH. TUNEL and Fluoro-Jade B staining showed that NSC 
      87877 treatment attenuated ICH-induced apoptosis and neuronal death, whereas 
      k252a treatment aggravated these pathological changes. The expression levels of 
      growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) and neurofilament 200 (NF200) were higher in 
      the ICH + NSC 87877 group compared with the ICH + vehicle group, but were lower 
      in the ICH + k252a group. Finally, we confirmed the protective role of 
      p-TrkB/TrkB in ICH by western blot. To sum up, our study identified the 
      inhibitory role of the Nogo-A/PirB/TrkB pathway in ICH; however, p-TrkB/TrkB may 
      serve as a potential target for secondary brain injury post-ICH.

AB  - It has been suggested that the dentate gyrus, particularly its new neurons 
      generated via adult neurogenesis, is involved in memory acquisition and recall. 
      Here, we trained rats in two types of Morris water maze tasks that are 
      differentially associated with these two memory processes, and examined whether 
      new neurons are differently affected by the two tasks performed during the second 
      week of neuronal birth. Our results indicate that the task involving more 
      opportunities to acquire new information better supports the survival of new 
      neurons. Further, we assessed whether the two tasks differentially induce the 
      expression of an immediate early gene, Zif268, which is known to be induced by 
      neuronal activation. While the two tasks differentially induce Zif268 expression 
      in the dentate gyrus, the proportions of new neurons activated were similar 
      between the two tasks. Thus, we conclude that while the two tasks differentially 
      activate the dentate gyrus, the task involving more opportunities for memory 
      acquisition during the second week of the birth of new neurons better promotes 
      the survival of the new neurons.

TI  - Accelerative effects of carbazole-type alkaloids from Murraya koenigii on neurite 
      outgrowth and their derivative's in vivo study for spatial memory.
PG  - 448-455

AB  - Murraya koenigii is a medicinal plant that contains several carbazole-type 
      alkaloids as its characteristic constituents. Blood-brain barrier permeable 
      constituents of M. koenigii accelerated neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells. Nine 
      compounds were isolated from M. koenigii and their effects on neurite outgrowth 
      were examined. Murrayamine-E (8) at 10 μM showed significant effect. Focusing on 
      the carbazole skeleton, we synthesized derivatives to attenuate cytotoxicity. 
      9-Benzyl-9H-carbazol-4-ol (15) exhibited strong neurite outgrowth accelerative 
      effect. In addition, the novel object recognition test and the Morris water maze 
      test were performed to evaluate memory improvement of 15 in APdE9 mice. Compound 
      15 tended to improve spatial memory in the Morris water maze test. These results 
      suggest that carbazole derivative 15 would be a seed compound for Alzheimer's 
      disease drug.

      Hippocampus and Reduces Learning and Memory in Rats.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is known to impair children's cognitive function. It has been 
      previously shown that developmental Pb exposure alters dendritic spine formation 
      in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. However, the underlying mechanism has not yet 
      been defined. In this study, a low-level gestational Pb exposure (GLE) rat model 
      was employed to investigate the impact of Pb on the spine density of the 
      hippocampal pyramidal neurons and its regulatory mechanism. Pb exposure resulted 
      in impaired performance of the rats in the Morris water maze tasks, and in 
      decreased EPSC amplitudes in hippocampal CA3-CA1 regions. With a 3D 
      reconstruction by the Imaris software, the results from Golgi staining showed 
      that the spine density in the CA1 region was reduced in the Pb-exposed rats in a 
      dose-dependent manner. Decreased spine density was also observed in cultured 
      hippocampal neurons following the Pb treatment. Furthermore, the expression level 
      of NLGN1, a postsynaptic protein that mediates synaptogenesis, was significantly 
      decreased following the Pb exposure both in vivo and in vitro. Up-regulation of 
      NLGN1 in cultured primary neurons partially attenuated the impact of Pb on the 
      spine density. Taken together, our resultssuggest that Pb exposure alters spine 
      plasticity in the developing hippocampus by down-regulating NLGN1 protein levels.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). 
      Previous studies have shown that the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 
      (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) that have 
      anti-diabetic properties show very promising effects in animal models of AD. 
      Glucagon (Gcg) is a hormone and growth-factor, and the Gcg receptor is expressed 
      in the brain. Here we test the effects of a triple receptor agonist (TA), which 
      activates GIP-1, GIP and glucagon receptors at the same time. In the present 
      study, the effects of the TA were evaluated in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model 
      of AD. The TA was injected once-daily (10 nmol/kg i.p.) for two months. The 
      results showed that treatment with TA significantly reversed the memory deficit 
      in the APP/PS1 mice in a spatial water maze test. Moreover, the drug reduced 
      levels of the mitochondrial pro-apoptotic signaling molecule BAX, increased the 
      anti-apoptotic signaling molecule Bcl-2 and enhanced the levels of BDNF, a key 
      growth factor that protects synaptic function. Levels of synaptophysin were 
      enhanced, demonstrating protection from synaptic loss that is observed in AD. 
      Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus was furthermore enhanced as shown in the 
      increase of doublecortin positive cells. Furthermore, TA treatment reduced the 
      total amount of β-amyloid, reduced neuroinflammation (activated microglia and 
      astrocytes), and oxidative stress in the cortex and hippocampus. Thus, these 
      findings show that novel TAs are a promising lead for the design of future 
      treatment strategies in AD.

TI  - Endurance training and MitoQ supplementation improve spatial memory, VEGF 
      expression, and neurogenic factors in hippocampal tissue of rats.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The hippocampus has a key role in memory and learning, which 
      means that this brain structure has high-energy demand. Accordingly, 
      mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampus has deleterious effects on brain 
      function. MitoQ is an antioxidant that accumulates selectively in mitochondria at 
      high concentration. In this study, the effect of MitoQ alone and in combination 
      with endurance training (ET) was investigated on spatial memory (distance, time, 
      and number of passes in the target quarter), antioxidant status (superoxide 
      dismutase [SOD] and glutathione peroxidase [GPx]), and neurogenic factor levels 
      (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] and brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
      [BDNF]) in male Wistar rats. METHODS: Rats were assigned to a control (CTL) 
      group, ET group, ET+MitoQ group, and a MitoQ group. Rats were trained on a 
      treadmill for 8 weeks, 5 days/week, and 50 min/day. MitoQ (250 μM daily) was 
      administered through drinking water for 8 weeks. Spatial memory (Morris water 
      maze test), gene expression (real-time PCR), protein expression (Western 
      blotting), and antioxidants (ELISA method) were determined. RESULTS: Distance and 
      number of passes in the target quarter in the ET, MitoQ, and ET+MitoQ groups were 
      higher than in the CTL group (P=0.001). MitoQ+ET had more impact on the 
      abovementioned indices than MitoQ or ET alone. Simultaneous use of MitoQ and ET 
      significantly increased gene and protein expression of VEGF (P=0.0001) and gene 
      expression of BDNF (P=0.004) and Sestrin 2 (SESN2) (P=0.0001) in hippocampal 
      tissue. The expression of VEGF (P=0.007) and SESN2 (P=0.001) was higher in the 
      MitoQ group compared to the CTL group. Tissue GPx levels were increased following 
      all three interventions (P≤0.013) compared to the CTL group while SOD levels 
      remained unchanged in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of ET and MitoQ 
      has additive effects on spatial memory in rats by modulating parameters that are 
      involved in hippocampal neurogenesis. In addition, MitoQ may have positive 
      effects on the antioxidant defense by improving GPx activity. RELEVANCE FOR 
      PATIENTS: Considering the positive effects of MitoQ on improving the memory and 
      the antioxidant defense, it seems that it can play a positive role in improving 
      the diseases associated with memory loss in the long term, and ET along with this 
      supplement can increase the possible positive effects.

TI  - Vildagliptin restores cognitive function and mitigates hippocampal neuronal

      BDNF signaling cascades.

AB  - Cisplatin (CP) is a broad-spectrum antineoplastic agent used to treat many human 
      cancers. Nonetheless, most patients receiving CP suffer from cognitive deficits, 
      a phenomenon termed "chemo-brain". Recently, vildagliptin (Vilda), a DPP-4 
      inhibitor, has demonstrated promising neuroprotective properties against various 
      neurological diseases. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the 
      potential neuroprotective properties of Vilda against CP-induced neurotoxicity 
      and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Chemo-brain was induced in 
      Sprague-Dawley rats by i.p injection of CP at a dose of 5 mg/kg once weekly for 
      four weeks. Vilda was administered daily at a dose (10 mg/kg; P.O) for four 
      weeks. The results revealed that Vilda restored the cognitive function impaired 
      by CP, as assessed by the Morris water maze, Y-maze, and passive avoidance tests. 
      Moreover, Vilda alleviated the CP-induced neurodegeneration, as shown by 
      toluidine blue staining, besides markedly reduced amyloid plaque deposition, as 
      evidenced by Congo red staining. Notably, Vilda boosted cholinergic 
      neurotransmission through the downregulation of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. 
      In addition, the neuroprotective mechanisms of Vilda include diminishing 
      oxidative stress by reducing MDA levels while raising GSH levels and SOD 
      activity, repressing neuronal apoptosis as shown by elevated Bcl-2 levels 
      together with diminished Bax and caspase-3 expressions, inhibiting 
      neuroinflammation as shown by decreased GFAP expression, and finally boosting 
      hippocampal neurogenesis and survival by upregulating expressions of BDNF and 
      PCNA. These effects were mainly mediated by activating AMPK/Akt/CREB signaling 
      cascades. In summary, Vilda can be considered a promising candidate for guarding 
      against CP-induced chemo-brain and neurodegeneration, thus improving the quality 
      of life of cancer patients.

AB  - We have previously reported cognitive impairments in both young and old mice, 
      particularly in female mice expressing mouse Arg-61 apoE, with a point mutation 
      to mimic the domain interaction feature of human apoE4, as compared to the 
      wildtype mouse (C57BL/6J) apoE. In this study, we further evaluated water maze 
      performance in the female Arg-61 mice at an additional time point and then 
      investigated related hippocampal cyto-architecture in these young female Arg-61 
      apoE mice vs. the wildtype mice. The results of behavioral performance 
      consistently support our previous report that the young female Arg-61 apoE showed 
      cognitive impairment versus C57BL/6J at the same age. The cyto-architectural 
      results showed that volume of the granular cell layer (GCL) was significantly 
      larger in both 5- and 10-month old Arg-61 apoE mice versus C57BL/6J mice. While 
      the number of newborn calretinin-positive neurons was greater in the sub-granular 
      zone (SGZ) in 5-month old Arg-61 mice, this number dropped significantly in 
      10-month old Arg-61 mice to a lower level than in age-matched C57BL/6J mice. In 
      addition, the amyloid β species was significantly higher in 5-month old Arg-61 
      mice versus age-matched C57BL/6J mice. In conclusion, impaired cognitive 
      functions in female Arg-61 apoE mice appear correlated with larger GCL volume and 
      higher calretinin-positive cell number and suggest a compensatory cellular 
      response that may be related to amyloid beta perturbations early in life. 
      Therefore this study suggests a novel cyto-architectural mechanism of 
      apoE4-dependent pathologies and increased susceptibility of APOEε4 subjects to 
      Alzheimer's disease.

      GABAnergic Neurons.

AB  - The BC-box motif in suppressor of cytokine signaling 6 (SOCS6) promotes the 
      neuronal differentiation of somatic stem cells, including epidermal stem cells. 
      SOCS6 protein belongs to the group of SOCS proteins and inhibits cytokine 
      signaling. Here we showed that epidermal stem cells were induced to differentiate 
      into GABAnergic neurons by the intracellular delivery of a peptide composed of 
      the amino-acid sequences encoded by the BC-box motif in SOCS6 protein. The BC-box 
      motif (SLQYLCRFVI) in SOCS6 corresponded to the binding site of elongin BC. 
      GABAnergic differentiation mediated by the BC-box motif in SOCS6 protein was 
      caused by ubiquitination of JAK2 and inhibition of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway. 
      Furthermore, GABAnergic neuron-like cells generated from epidermal stem cells 
      were transplanted into the brain of a rodent ischemic model. Then, we 
      demonstrated that these transplanted cells were GAD positive and that the 
      cognitive function of the ischemic model rodents with the transplanted cells was 
      improved. This study could contribute to not only elucidating the mechanism of 
      GABAnergic neuronal differentiation but also to neuronal regenerative medicine 
      utilizing GABAnergic neurons.
